Currently, the /Art of the Grammarian/ contains 25 separate sections, each outlining a different rule for grammarians to follow. This may or may not have been the original configuration; scholars believe that while later scribes kept Dionysius' ideas in tact while passing his work onto new manuscripts, they may have adjusted the formatting or pared it down [I think Professor Smith said this - find a source to corroborate and cite]. In my research, I focused on the first section, in which Dionysius laid out his six fundamental steps towards interacting thoroughly with a text:

>ΠΕΡΙ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΙΚΗΣ.
>Γραμματική ἐστιν ἐμπειρία τῶν παρὰ ποιηταῖς τε καὶ συγγραφεῦσιν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ λεγομένων. Μέρη δὲ αὐτῆς εἰσὶν ἕξ· πρῶτον ἀνάγνωσις ἐντριβὴς κατὰ προσῳδίαν, >δεύτερον ἐξήγησις κατὰ τοὺς ἐνυπάρχοντας ποιητικοὺς τρόπους, τρίτον γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἱστοριῶν πρόχειρος ἀπόδοσις, τέταρτον ἐτυμολογίας εὕρεσις, πέμπτον ἀναλογίας >ἐκλογισμός, ἕκτον κρίσις ποιημάτων, ὃ δὴ κάλλιστόν ἐστι πάντων τῶν ἐν τῇ τέχνῃ.

In the context of literary criticism, ανάγνωσίς refers to reading the text aloud. Before a grammarian can fully understand a text, or even progress to the next steps towards understanding, Dionysius asserts that they must be able to recite the text orally. This method of reading ensures that the scholar internalizes the meter, the pauses, and other facets of the poetry outside of the story itself.




In order to better understand the overlap between Dionysius Thrax's methodology and the scholiast's, I have divided the verbal adjectives into three groups in the table below. The first group has the aforementioned words of marking and pronouncing, which maps easily onto Dionysius' first rule. The other two categories map on less directly, but [something something something]...
