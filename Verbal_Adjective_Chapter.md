Within the scholia, verbal adjectives ending in -τεον (-teon) convey an imperative tone without using the imperative. Out of the seventy-three verbal adjectives which appear in the Venetus A scholia, only two refer exclusively to what a character must do within the text - πολεμητέον (polemeteon) and φυλακτέον (fulakteon), meaning "one must fight" and "one must stand guard" respectively. All seventy-one remaining verbal adjectives refer to what the scholiast believes he must do pertaining to his craft, and what he feels his readers must do in order to understand the text fully. 

The most frequently occurring verbal adjectives pertain to pronunciation. The most frequently appearing verbal adjective by far, appearing 156 times, is δίασταλτέον (diastalteon). Δίασταλτέον means "one must distinguish," often referring to the placement of a comma - and thus, the timing of a short pause in the recitation of the text. Continuing this trend, nearly every verbal adjective that appears more than thirty times in the scholia refers to pronunciation. These include ὑποστικτέον (51 times), περισπαστέον (49 times), συναπτέον (45 times), and δασυντέον (34 times). The only exception to this rule is ῥητέον (51 times), meaning "one must mention." Other than that, all of the most frequently-appearing verbal adjectives refer to which syllables of the text should be combined, separated, and accented. This emphasis on pronunciation mirrors the text of Dionysius Thrax, whose first and most fundamental rule to engaging with a text denotes the importance of reading the text aloud. 

In order to better understand the overlap between Dionysius Thrax's methodology and the scholiast's, I have divided the verbal adjectives into three groups in the table below. The first group has the aforementioned words of marking and pronouncing, which maps easily onto Dionysius' first rule. The other two categories map on less directly, but [something something something]...
