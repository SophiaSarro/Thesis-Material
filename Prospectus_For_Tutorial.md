**Sophia Sarro: tutorial prospectus**

I am proposing a second tutorial on the literary-critical interests of Homeric "grammarians" (*grammatikoi*, a term that in antiquity encompasses what we might call "scholars of literature"). Throughout the past semester, I have worked both with manuscripts and secondary scholarship to understand in particular the  literary-critical tradition deriving from Aristarchus of Samothrace, and how it was utilized and adapted by later scholars.

One part of my work has been to return to the manuscript evidence for the critical practice of using critical sign.  Building on work I did as a research associate for Prof. Smith last summer, I have been since August working with him and  Professor Graeme Bird (Gordon College), an expert on critical signs who has also agreed to be a reader on my thesis, to edit and translate relevant manuscripts which have received little recognition in the past. The translations and accompanying commentaries will be included as appendicies to my thesis, while the digital transcriptions will be released online so that other scholars may use them. I have also been surveying modern scholarship, I have been reading the recent works by Francesca Schironi and Rene Nunlist in order to understand how modern scholars have approached similar questions, and what work on this front still needs to be done.

Attached to this proposal, you will find my current thesis outline. The first section of the thesis exists in draft form. The second and seventh are currently underway, and I plan to have drafts of them completed by the end of the semester.  From one part of this section, I am currently developing a discussion of technical vocabulary in the *scholia* of the Venetus A to submit as part of a panel proposal on "The Art of the Scholar of Letters" for the Classical Association of New England's spring meeting, together with Professor Smith, Professor Bird and Luke Giuntoli '21.

The remaining sections of my outline, then, would be the focus of next semester's tutorial. In the tutorial, I will draw on the understanding we have gained about Aristonicus, Aristarchus, and other scholars through our manuscript research to focus my analysis on particular sets of scholia. I will also expand upon my fall work with the digital edition of the scholia to see if we can use topic modelling to isolate particular scholarly interests in the scholia.  Overall, the goal of this tutorial is to explore how we can use manuscript evidence and computational analysis if digital editions to further understand the literary-critical interests of ancient grammarians whose works no longer survive.




***Outline:***

MAIN IDEA 1: WORKING WITH WORDS

Section One: In this section, I will give an overview of the Aristarchan tradition, as well as the main figures who will be discussed in the thesis - specifically, Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus.

Section Two: This section serves as an introduction to one of the major primary sources I have been working with, the _Τέχνη γραμματική_ of Dionysius Thrax. I will particularly focus on the grammarian's six elements of literary study, which will be a recurring theme throughout my research.

MAIN IDEA 2: WORKING WITH CRITICAL SIGNS

Section Three: After discussing Dionysius Thrax, I will turn to the other primary sources. Section three will discuss the page of Aristonicus' _περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_ which is uniquely preserved in the Venetus A manuscript. A full translation and commentary on this page will be available to readers of the thesis as an appendix.

Section Four: This section will cover the page of the manuscript Harley 5693 (British Library) which I have worked on with Professor Smith and Professor Bird. Like the page of _περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_, this page also tells how a scribe utilized the signs of the Aristarchan tradition. As it is from a later (though uncertain) date, I can compare it to the page in the Venetus A in order to show how the tradition evolved.

Section Five: This will cover the latest grammatical treatise we are studying, a few pages attributed to the grammarian Suetonius from the manuscript Paris grec 7530. This Latin manuscript is longer than the surviving Greek discussions of critical signs, and shows how the technical apparatus of Aristarchan tradition was incorporated into Latin critical scholarship.

MAIN IDEA 3: WORKING WITH WORDS AND CRITICAL SIGNS DIGITALLY

Section Six: This section will introduce topic modelling, a digital technique which we are using in order to isolate and identify the various interests of the grammarians.

Section Seven: In this section, I will use topic modelling to examine to what extent the literary critical concerns of the Venetus A scholiast correspond to the concerns of Dionysius Thrax, as mentioned in Section One.

Section Eight: This section will draw all of the aforementioned points together and conclude the thesis.
