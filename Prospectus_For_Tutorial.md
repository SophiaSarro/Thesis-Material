I am proposing a second tutorial on the literary-critical interests of Homeric grammarians. Throughout the past semester, I have worked both with manuscripts and secondary scholarship to understand the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition, and how it was utilized and adapted by later scholars. In terms of manuscript research, Professor Smith and I have worked alongside Professor Bird, a professor at Gordon College and expert on critical signs who has also agreed to be a reader on my thesis, to edit and translate relevant manuscripts which have received little recognition in the past. The translations and accompanying commentaries will be included as appendacies to my thesis, while the digital transcriptions will be released online so that other scholars may use them. Regarding more modern scholarship, I have been reading the recent works by Francesca Schironi and Rene Nunlist in order to understand how modern scholars have approached a similar topic, and what work on this front still needs to be done.

Attached to this proposal, you will find my current thesis outline. The first section of the thesis exists in draft form. The second and sixth are currently underway, and I plan to have drafts of them completed by the end of the semester; during the second semester, I plan to present these sections as part of a panel at the upcoming CANE conference. The remaining sections of my outline, then, would be the focus of next semester's tutorial. The tutorial will focus on condensing the information we have gathered about Aristonicus and other scholars through our manuscript research into a more concrete display of how the Aristarchan tradition of literary criticism evolved. It will also expand upon this semester’s work with digital humanities. This semester, Dionysius Thrax took precedence in terms of topic modelling, as the deadline for the CANE conference is before the deadline for the thesis itself. During next semester’s tutorial, I hope to expand our work on topic models beyond what we have done with Dionysius Thrax, in order to understand the other literary critics whose works we are examining in the same depth. Overall, the goal of this tutorial is further understand the literary-critical interests of grammarians who we have begun to examine this semester.



***Outline:***

MAIN IDEA 1: WORKING WITH WORDS

Section One: In this section, I will give an overview of the Aristarchan tradition, as well as the main figures who will be discussed in the thesis - specifically, Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus.

Section Two: This section serves as an introduction to one of the major primary sources I have been working with: 


MAIN IDEA 2: WORKING WITH CRITICAL SIGNS

Section Three: Aristonicus

Explain who Aristonicus was.
Explain that a page of his work, thought to be at least comparable to the original, is in the beginning of the Venetus A.
How are critical signs used in the Ven A? Does the scribe follow through and use them in the way that Aristonicus outlines?
Section Four: The Harley Manuscript

Ask Professor Smith the approximate age of this passage. We're trying to keep things in chronological order.
How does the Harley scribe think that critical signs should be used?
Compare and contrast with Aristonicus.
MAIN IDEA 3: WORKING WITH WORDS AND CRITICAL SIGNS DIGITALLY

Section Five: Intro to Topic Modelling

How is it done?
Discuss Professor Smith's new parsing program, and the advantages to using it over Morpheus
"When the topic modelling is done, we can expect to see multiple clusters of words; these clusters have no inherent meaning, but we can assign them meaning"
Section Six: Topic Modelling Verbal Adjectives

Explain the significance of words in the -τεον found in the Venetus A scholia
Are there patterns as to which words frequently co-occur with verbal adjectives?
Section Seven: Topic Modelling With Critical Signs

Are there words and critical signs that frequently co-occur?
Are the critical signs used the same in each manuscript? Which clusters show up for which critical signs in which manuscripts?
