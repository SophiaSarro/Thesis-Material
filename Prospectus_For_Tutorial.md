In next semester's tutorial, I plan to continue our research on the the literary criticism of Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus in order to understand the progression of the Homeric literary-critical tradition. In order to broaden our understanding of literary criticism, we will incorporate the Suetonius manuscript which we have started examining with Professor Bird. As it is further removed from the Aristarchan tradition than the other sources we have covered, this will give us insight as to how the Aristarchan critical signs were folded into other literary traditions. In addition, using the recently-released topic modelling program, we will create topic models in order to understand the individual topics covered by the scholia, and single out those which relate to our research. We will then incorporate this research into a presentation for a panel at the CANE conference.
