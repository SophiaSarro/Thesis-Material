I am proposing a second tutorial on the literary-critical interests of Homeric grammarians. Throughout the past semester, I have worked both with manuscripts and secondary scholarship to understand the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition, and how it was utilized and adapted by later scholars. In terms of manuscript research, Professor Smith and I have worked alongside Professor Bird, a professor at Gordon College and expert on critical signs who has also agreed to be a reader on my thesis, to edit and translate relevant manuscripts which have received little recognition in the past. The translations and accompanying commentaries will be included as appendacies to my thesis, while the digital transcriptions will be released online so that other scholars may use them. Regarding more modern scholarship, I have been reading the recent works by Francesca Schironi and Rene Nunlist in order to understand how modern scholars have approached a similar topic, and what work on this front still needs to be done.

Attached to this proposal, you will find my current thesis outline. The first section of the thesis exists in draft form. The second and seventh are currently underway, and I plan to have drafts of them completed by the end of the semester. During the second semester, I plan to present these sections as part of a panel at the upcoming CANE conference. The remaining sections of my outline, then, would be the focus of next semester's tutorial. The tutorial will focus on condensing the information we have gathered about Aristonicus and other scholars through our manuscript research into a more concrete display of how the Aristarchan tradition of literary criticism evolved. It will also expand upon this semester’s work with digital humanities. This semester, Dionysius Thrax took precedence in terms of topic modelling, as the deadline for the CANE conference is before the deadline for the thesis itself. During next semester’s tutorial, I hope to expand our work on topic models beyond what we have done with Dionysius Thrax, in order to understand the other literary critics whose works we are examining in the same depth. Overall, the goal of this tutorial is further understand the literary-critical interests of grammarians who we have begun to examine this semester.



***Outline:***

MAIN IDEA 1: WORKING WITH WORDS

Section One: In this section, I will give an overview of the Aristarchan tradition, as well as the main figures who will be discussed in the thesis - specifically, Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus.

Section Two: This section serves as an introduction to one of the major primary sources I have been working with, the _Τέχνη γραμματική_ of Dionysius Thrax. I will particularly focus on the grammarian's six steps to thoroughly understanding a text, which will be a recurring theme throughout my research. 

MAIN IDEA 2: WORKING WITH CRITICAL SIGNS

Section Three: After discussing Dionysius Thrax, it makes sense to cover the other primary sources. Section three will discuss the page of Aristonicus' _περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_ which was preserved as paratext to the Venetus A manuscript. A full translation and commentary on this page will be available to readers of the thesis as an appendix.

Section Four: This section will cover the page of the Harley manuscript which I have worked on with Professor Smith and Professor Bird. Like the page of _περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_, this page also tells how a scribe utilized the signs of the Aristarchan tradition. As it is from a later (though uncertain) date, I can compare it to the page in the Venetus A in order to show how the tradition evolved.

Section Five: This will cover the latest grammatical treatise we are studying, a few pages from the περὶ Paris 7530 manuscript attributed to Suetonius. This Latin manuscript provides much contrast from the aforementioned primary sources, and demonstrates how the Aristarchan tradition was blended into other critical traditions throughout the centuries.

MAIN IDEA 3: WORKING WITH WORDS AND CRITICAL SIGNS DIGITALLY

Section Six: This section will introduce topic modelling, a digital technique which we are using in order to isolate and identify the various interests of the grammarians. 

Section Seven: In this section, I will use topic modelling to examine to what extent the literary critical concerns of the Venetus A scholiast correspond to the concerns of Dionysius Thrax, as mentioned in Section One.

Section Eight: This section will draw all of the aforementioned points together and conclude the thesis.
