Throughout this past semester, we have examined the literary criticism of Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus in order to understand the progression of the Homeric literary-critical tradition. I would like to continue this research next semester in another tutorial. This tutorial would continue our coverage of the aforementioned literary critics, as well as incorporating the Suetonius manuscript which we have started examining with Professor Bird. We will examine the scholia, the critical signs, and pieces written about the critical signs in order to piece together how literary critics viewed their own craft. Additionally, with the new program you introduced to me last class, we will create topic models in order to understand the individual topics covered by the scholia, and single out those which relate to our research. I feel that this is significantly different than any course being offered next semester, which justifies the need for a tutorial.
