The following thesis explores the intertwined literary [maybe "literary-critical" or "scholarly"?] works of four Homeric critics: Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus. Before analyzing the literary traditions themselves, it is important to establish that each of them currently exist in different states of completion. Zenodotus' and Aristarchus' works  works are all lost, but some of their phrasing survives ["can be identified"?] in Homeric scholia [", as I will show in chapter x"].  Dionysius Thrax's Τέχνη γραμματική has been passed down in a condensed form which scholars [assume] bears resemblance to the original. [Need footnote on this scholarly consensus.] Only a ["single"?] page of Aristonicus' περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας survives [", folio eight recto of the Venetus A manuscript (Marciana 454 = 822)"].

Because the corpus of these scholars is so sparse, it is nearly impossible to understand the works of each of these grammarians in isolation; however, when the works are considered in tandem with the grammarians' historical context and relation to each other, scholars ["we" ?] can begin to see patterns that would otherwise not have emerged. For instance, the aforementioned page of περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας may seem unimpressive at first - what use is one out-of-context page of a presumably expansive work? The contents of the work do little to allay this suspicion, as it merely explains the uses of critical signs, which could have been figured out without the use of this guide. The page becomes more important, however, when it is understood as part of an intergenerational discourse between Alexandrian scholars. The critical signs in question are Aristarchus', some of which he used to call into question the previous editing of Zenodotus. Aristonarchus not only provides a user's manual to critical editions of Homeric texts, but reconstructs an earlier discrepency between grammarians and presents it to his audience, implying that Zenodotus and Aristarchus did not exhaust the issue and further exploration is warranted.
