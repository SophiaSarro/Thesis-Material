The following thesis explores the intertwined literary [maybe "literary-critical" or "scholarly"?] works of four Homeric critics: Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Dionysius Thrax, and Aristonicus. Before analyzing the literary traditions themselves, it is important to establish that each of them currently exist in different states of completion. Zenodotus' and Aristarchus' works  works are all lost, but some of their phrasing survives ["can be identified"?] in Homeric scholia [", as I will show in chapter x"].  Dionysius Thrax's Τέχνη γραμματική has been passed down in a condensed form which scholars [assume] bears resemblance to the original. [Need footnote on this scholarly consensus.] Only a ["single"?] page of Aristonicus' περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας survives [", folio eight recto of the Venetus A manuscript (Marciana 454 = 822)"].

Because the corpus of these scholars is so sparse, it is nearly impossible to understand the works of each of these grammarians in isolation; however, when the works are considered in tandem with the grammarians' historical context and relation to each other, scholars ["we" ?] can begin to see patterns that would otherwise not have emerged. For instance, the aforementioned page of περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας may seem unimpressive at first - what use is one out-of-context page of a presumably expansive work? The contents of the work do little to allay this suspicion, as it merely explains the uses of critical signs, which could have been figured out without the use of this guide. The page becomes more important, however, when it is understood as part of an intergenerational discourse between Alexandrian scholars. The critical signs in question are Aristarchus', some of which he used to call into question the previous editing of Zenodotus. Aristonarchus not only provides a user's manual to critical editions of Homeric texts, but reconstructs an earlier discrepancy between grammarians and presents it to his audience, implying that Zenodotus and Aristarchus did not exhaust the issue and further exploration is warranted.

Zenodotus of Ephesus, who lived during the 3rd century BCE, was the first superintendant of the Library of Alexandria. His critical work on Homer inspired an entire literary tradition - seemingly because his successor, Aristarchus, disagreed with so much of it. Zenodotus took it upon himself to athetize lines of the Iliad and Odyssey that he thought were un-Homeric. Interestingly, he also edited Hesiod's Theogony. He notably composed a list called the γλωσσαι of irregular words to supplement his scholarship. This seems similar to the Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι written by his teacher, Philitas of Cos.

Aristarchus' works are preserved in fragment form in the works of other writers. His works ceased to exist shortly after his death, so that "[within] a few generations after his death, his successors at Alexandria were desperately trying to reconstruct and preserve his work" (Schironi, 7, 1). This is partially because his works were not intended for a large audience. Instead, they were composed for other scholars in the Library of Alexandria to use.

Aristarchus allegedly died in Cyprus, possibly in exile. As Ptolemy Physcon exiled scholarly contemporaries of Aristarchus upon usurping the throne and becoming Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, it is likely that his former student exiled him (Schironi, 5, 1). However, that is not definitive - "Athenaeus, our source for these events, only remarks that under Ptolemy VIII many intellectuals left Alexandria and settled on islands and in cities of the Mediterranean, and that this intellectual ‘diaspora’ spread Alexandrian culture throughout the Mediterranean, giving rise to a new cultural renaissance outside of Egypt" (Schironi, 5, 1).

mportant: Zenodotus wrote the γλωσσαι, which is allegedly a formal list of unusual words that later scholars used when they cited Zenodotus. When Dionysius Thrax wrote his third point, about γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἱστοριῶν, was he referencing Zenodotus' list in particular?

Aristonicus of Alexandria was a Homeric scholar who lived between the late first century BCE and early first century CE. (I can't find the exact years for some reason. Come back to that.) He wrote Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας, which explained the uses of the critical signs used by Aristarchus. This work does not exist in full, but a page, thought to be in a minimally altered state from the original, survived in the Venetus A manuscript of the Iliad.
