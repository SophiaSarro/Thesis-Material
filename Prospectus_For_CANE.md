As part of the larger panel on Dionysius Thrax, my research focuses on the overlap between the Dionysius' methods for understanding a text and the scholiast of the Venetus A's understanding of his own work. Specifically, I will examine verbal adjectives ending in -τεον, which carry a connotation of necessity, as explicit statements of what the scholiast felt he or his reader must do. Through topic modelling, I will identify which words appear in tandem with the verbal adjectives most frequently, and will sort the verbal adjectives and corresponding words into "topics." I will then investigate whether the topics map on to Dionysius Thrax's methods for understanding a text, or whether the Venetus A scholiast had a vastly different method for interpreting a text thoroughly.
