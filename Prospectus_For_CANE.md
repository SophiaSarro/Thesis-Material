As part of the larger panel on Dionysius Thrax, my research focuses on the overlap between the Dionysius' methods for understanding a text and the scholiast of the Venetus A's understanding of his own work. Specifically, I will examine verbal adjectives ending in -τεον, which carry a connotation of necessity, as explicit statements of what the scholiast felt he or his reader must do.
