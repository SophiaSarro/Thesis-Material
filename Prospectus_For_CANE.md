My research explores the overlap between the literary-critical interests of Dionysius Thrax and the scribe of the Venetus A manuscript. In his _Τέχνη γραμματική_, Dionysius Thrax establishes six steps for understanding a text thoroughly. The scholiast of the Venetus A may not list his interests as concisely, but he did distinguish his literary-critical vocabulary by presenting them as verbal adjectives ending in -τεον. These verbal adjectives work similarly to Dionysius' explicit rules, explaining what the scholiast thought he or his readers must do in order to understand the text fully. In order to organize these verbal adjectives, which are spread throughout the scholia, into a more concise form which would be comparable to Dionysius' list, I will use topic models of the verbal adjectives and the words with which they appear the most frequently. This method creates 'topics,' or clusters of co-occuring words with no inherent meaning, but to which we can ascribe meaning based on relation between the words. By analyzing how closely the words in each topic align with the categories of literary-critical understanding layed out by Dionysius Thrax, I will determine to what extent his view of his own craft aligned with the view of the Venetus A scholiast.
