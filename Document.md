Okay, I'm kind of lost so let's just do a stream of consciousness thing to establish what I still have to do.

First of all, the chapter on verbal adjectives is so close to being done. I just have to write the intro/conclusion and revise it a bunch of times. I'm not sure if my points about aspiration/accentuation actually make sense, so I'll have to ask Professor Smith about that. If those turn out to be valid points, I should also do more research on the differences between how Dionysius Thrax would pronounce Greek and how the Ven A scholiast would pronounce Greek. The tonality is presumably a big part of the poetry, and I can't imagine that the scholiast, who fixates on Dionysius' first point so much, would just ignore it if he's going to go to all the trouble of correcting accents and such. 

After that, I should reformat that chapter just a bit for the CANE panel. Also, I should ask Professor Smith about how this whole panel thing works. I lowkey forgot how quickly the CANE conference was approaching, so this really can't be put off any more.

Speaking of approaching deadlines, March is coming up FAST. Let's bang out another chapter, or at least get one to the point that the Verbal Adjectives chapter is now, by the end of the week. I already have the People section partially done, so that shouldn't be so difficult. I just have to take my notes and turn them into something that makes sense. I have PLANS for that chapter, and it's kind of frustrating that nothing is taking shape the way I want it to. In order to avoid the same problems I ran into with the Verbal Adjectives chapter, I should make a far more detailed outline of the chapter ahead of time. 

It honestly feels like I'm at a potter's wheel and the clay keeps collapsing in on itself. I'm working with this big lump of stuff, and I have an idea of how I want to shape it, but I can't physically form it into that shape. Maybe I should ask Dane and Luke how their writing process is coming? Professor Perry probably has office hours too, so I could ask her.
