If this thesis aims to establish what literary-critical interests the Venetus A scholiast shares with foundational members of the Aristarchan tradition, it must first define who those members are, and what interests they had. The following will by no means be an exhaustive account of scholars who followed Aristarchus and all of their works; instead, I will provide an introduction to a few proponents of the Aristarchan tradition whose contributions were significant, and who were substantially connected to either Aristarchus himself or his works. This allows us to get as close as possible to the source of the tradition without looking at the works of Aristarchus himself. Admittedly, looking at the eight hundred-some works that Aristarchus reportedly wrote would be the ideal method, but as none of those works survive today, we can only learn about Aristarchus' methodology through the works of those around him.

As such, our account of the Aristarchan tradition must reach back before Aristarchus himself. It actually starts with Zenodotus of Ephesus, a grammarian during the 3rd century BCE who served as the first superintendant of the Library of Alexandria. While his colleagues at the Library, Alexander of Aetolia and Lycophron of Calchis, studied theatre, Zenodotus specialized in epic poetry and became the first critical editor of Homer. As part of his studies, Zenodotus compiled a list of uncommon words and their definitions, known as the _Γλῶσσαι_. Along with hypothesizing about these words that had fallen out of use, Zenodotus took it upon himself to mark lines of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ which he thought were later additions, using a horizontal line called an _obelos_. This was the first recorded use of the _σημεῖα_ for literary criticism.

**Aristarchus of Samothrace:**

His successor at the Library of Alexandria, Aristarchus of Samothrace (216-144 BCE), took it upon himself to expand upon and revise Zenodotus' fledgling field of Homeric criticism - seemingly because he disagreed with so much of it. Along with debating whether lines obelized by Zenodotus were truly un-Homeric, Aristarchus also created more _σημεῖον_ so that he could easily indicate more concepts. Among these were the _ἀστερίσκος_, _σίγμα_, and _ἀντίσιγμα_. Now, instead of merely indicating which lines were un-Homeric, the _σημεῖα_ could also point out misplaced and duplicate lines. While Zenodotus had started the field of Homeric literary criticism, Aristarchus added necessary components in order to make it more applicable and exact.

The _Suda_, a 10th century document which provides a biography of Aristarchus, claims that Aristarchus "λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων." Unfortunately, this figure of eight hundred books cannot be verified, as none of Aristarchus' works are extant today. Thus, when seeking to understand the Aristarchan tradition, modern scholars can never piece it together from Aristarchus' own words. We can, however, use the words of a man who was close to him.

**Dionysius Thrax:**

Dionysius Thrax (170-90 BCE) was one of Aristarchus' students, and went on to become one of the best-remembered grammarians of his time. His work _Τέχνη γραμματική_ outlasted Aristarchus' corpus by far and still exists today, allowing scholars to glimpse how someone heavily influenced by Aristarchus viewed literary criticism. At the beginning of _Τέχνη γραμματική_, 

First, practiced oral reading with regard to prosody
Second, explanation in accordance with the poetic figures
Third, accounting for words and background information
Fourth, discovery of etymologies
Fifth, setting out paradigms
Sixth, krisis of the poems, which is the most beautiful aspect of the art

Dionysius took a vastly different approach to scholarship than the aforementioned grammarians, which is probably why his works outlasted theirs almost in its entirety. Aristarchus' works cannot be divorced from their Homeric context, and were specifically intended to inform future students at the Library of the emerging field of Homeric literary criticism. Dionysius, on the other hand, covered far more universal topics in his _Τέχνη γραμματική_, such as nouns, conjunctions, and conjugation. An audiance which was not studying Homer at the Library of Alexandria would still have use for Dionysius' text, which resulted in it being passed down as a somewhat definitive guide to grammar for the subsequent centuries. Thus, in the generations before scholars began reconstructing Aristarchus' works, the prolific works of Dionysius and his other students still attested his worth as a scholar.

**Aristonicus of Alexandria:**

As of the late first century BCE, when his students were no longer around to carry on his teachings, the movement to reconstruct Aristarchus' works had begun. Aristonicus of Alexandria contributed to this movement through his _Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_, which explained the functions of the critical signs used by Aristarchus. His non-Aristarchan works, _Περὶ τῆς Μενελάου πλάνης_ and _ἀσυντάκτων ὀνομάτων βιβλία_, unfortunately did not survive; however, once the world had a second chance to preserve the Aristarchan tradition, it would not go to waste; one page of _Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_ was preserved in the Venetus A manuscript of the _Iliad_, confirming that Aristonicus' work on Aristarchus was still being actively replicated as of the tenth century CE.
