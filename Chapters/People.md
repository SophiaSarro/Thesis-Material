If this thesis aims to establish what literary-critical interests the Venetus A scholiast shares with foundational members of the Aristarchan tradition, it must first define who those members are, and what interests they had. The following will by no means be an exhaustive account of scholars who followed Aristarchus and all of their works; instead, I will provide an introduction to a few proponents of the Aristarchan tradition whose contributions were significant, and who were substantially connected to either Aristarchus himself or his works. This allows us to get as close as possible to the source of the tradition without looking at the works of Aristarchus himself. Admittedly, looking at the eight hundred-some works that Aristarchus reportedly wrote would be the ideal method, but as none of those works survive today, we can only learn about Aristarchus' methodology through the works of those around him.

The creation of the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition is intrinsically tied to the creation of the critical edition during the 3rd century BCE. Zenodotus of Ephesus, the first superintendant of the Library of Alexandria, took it upon himself to determine which lines of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ were genuinely "Homeric". Zenodotus was under the impression that these epic poems had been composed perfectly by a single author, and that later scribes had corrupted the story by adding spurious lines. Consequently, he set out to edit lines which he deemed to be fake out of the text, thereby creating the first critical edition of a text. 

**Aristarchus of Samothrace:**

Aristarchus of Samothrace (216-144 BCE) succeeded Zenodotus as the superintendent of the Library of Alexandria. During his tenure, Aristarchus took it upon himself to expand upon and revise Zenodotus' fledgling field of Homeric criticism, seemingly because he disagreed with so much of it. When writing editions of the Homeric epics, Zenodotus had used one  _σημεῖον_ (critical sign), called the obelos, to mark lines which he though were un-Homeric. Along with adopting the obelos, Aristarchus also created more _σημεῖα_ so that he could easily indicate more concepts. Among these were the _ἀστερίσκος_, _σίγμα_, and _ἀντίσιγμα_. Now, instead of merely indicating which lines were un-Homeric, the _σημεῖα_ could also point out misplaced and duplicate lines. While Zenodotus had started the field of Homeric literary criticism, Aristarchus added necessary components in order to make it more applicable and exact.

The _Suda_, a 10th century document which provides a biography of Aristarchus, claims that Aristarchus "λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων." Unfortunately, this figure of eight hundred books cannot be verified, as none of Aristarchus' works are extant today. Thus, when seeking to understand the Aristarchan tradition, modern scholars can never piece it together from Aristarchus' own words. We can, however, use the words of a man who was close to him.

**Dionysius Thrax:**

Dionysius Thrax (170-90 BCE) was a student of Aristarchus who went on to become one of the best-remembered grammarians of his time. His work _Τέχνη γραμματική_ outlines his views on the newly-developing field of literary criticism, and provides a list of what a scholar must understand about a text before creating his own critical edition. When studying the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition, Dionysius Thrax is a key figure for three reasons. The first reason, of course, is that he studied under Aristarchus. As the field was so new, his views were undoubtedly influenced greatly by those of his teacher, and understanding how Dionysius viewed literary criticism provides insight into how Aristarchus probably viewed it. The second reason is simply that his work survived. This may seem obvious, but since so many texts relevant to the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition no longer exist, scholars hoping to understand Aristarchus' methodology must capitalize on any available primary source. The third reason is that _Τέχνη γραμματική_ became the quintessential Greek text in post-Classical Europe. Long after Aristarchus' 800 books had blinked out existence, _Τέχνη γραμματική_ was the text which introduced many scholars to the Aristarchan tradition well into the Middle Ages. Therefore, it seems likely that a tenth century scholiast, such as the man behind the Venetus A manuscript, would have gained at least some of his knowledge of Aristarcus' legacy through the lens of Dionysius.

**Aristonicus of Alexandria:**

During the Augustan Age, Aristonicus of Alexandria created another crucial text in understanding the Aristarchan tradition. His work  _Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_ commented on the works of Aristarchus and explained the functions of his critical signs. The scholiast of the Venetus A manuscript included a transcription of _Περὶ τῶν σημείων_ in the beginning of his manuscript, confirming that Aristonicus' was still being read and replicated by scholars as of the tenth century CE. However, while _Περὶ τῶν σημείων_ may have influenced the scholiast's view of Aristarchus, it cannot have the same impact on modern scholars. While the Venetus A was being re-bound, all but one of the pages of _Περὶ τῶν σημείων_ disappeared. The only surviving page in the Venetus A eventually became the only surviving page in general, as no other copies of _Περὶ τῶν σημείων_, or any of Aristonicus' other scholarship, are known to exist today.

**George Choiroboskos:**

Not much is known about the life of George Choiroboskos. In fact, his life could have taken place any time from the fifth through the ninth centuries CE. What is know, however, is that he wrote commentaries on the works of many important scholars, including Dionysius Thrax. While the commentary on Dionysius does not still exist in its entirety, some of what Choiroboskos said about Dionysius Thrax lives on through the scholia in manuscripts of _Τέχνη γραμματική_. As is the case with Aristonicus, what modern scholars can learn from Choiroboskos is limited; but the Venetus A scholiast, living within a few centuries of him, could have learned much more from him.
