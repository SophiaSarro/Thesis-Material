Aristarchus of Samothrace was supposed to die in obscurity. When Ptolemy VIII exiled Aristarchus and his contemporary scholars from Alexandria, his goal was to eliminate their cultural impact in order to bolster his own. Ptolemy may have cut Aristarchus' legacy short, preventing Aristarchus from conducting more scholarship as the superintendant of the Library of Alexandria, but he by no means eliminated it. Instead, the literary-critical tradition that Aristarchus started influenced scholars well into the Middle Ages. The seimeia, or critical signs, invented by Aristarchus still hold cultural relevance today, as Aristarchus invented the asterisk. This thesis aims to explore the forms in which the literary-critical tradition survived, allowing it to outlast its creator by centuries. While it is not an exhaustive account of the works of scholars influenced by Aristarchus, and through whom the tradition carried on, the thesis examines the works of Aristonicus of Alexandria, Dionysius Thrax, and George Choiroboskos, and their respective influence on the scholiast of theVenetus A manuscript of the _Iliad_. Although the manuscript's composition in the tenth century C.E. places the Venetus A scholiast at a twelve century separation from Aristarchus, this paper aims to prove, through close readings and topic models of the scholia, that the Venetus A scholiast shares many literary-critical interests with notable proponents of the Aristarchan tradition.

The thesis itself consists of three chapters, each covering a different aspect that will lead to the overall understanding of the Aristarchan tradition. The first chapter explains the evolution of the Aristarchan tradition through the texts left behind by Dionysius Thrax, Aristonicus, and George Choiroboskos. 

Additionally, this thesis includes several visual aids to better illustrate my findings. Section A of the appendices includes two tables of verbal adjectives, the creation and significance of which are covered in Chapter 2. Section B of the appendices consists of several topic models, which present the findings discussed in Chapter 3. While Chapter 3 provides a verbal explanation of the features of these topic models that I found to be the most noteworthy, topic models are intrinsically a visual mode of communication, and no written explanation of the models could be nearly as effective as showing them directly. Lastly, Section C of the appendices contains the newest diplomatic edition and translation of _περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_ by Aristonicus of Alexandria. Co-authored by Professor Neel Smith from the College of the Holy Cross, Professor Graeme Bird from Gordon College, and myself, this edition and translation aim to be as true as possible to words of Aristonicus as they are preserved in the Venetus A. I have included this as part of the appendices as primary sources - including our new edition of _περὶ τῶν σημείων_, provided much of the information used for this thesis.
