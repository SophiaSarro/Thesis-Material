As mentioned in the previous chapter, the _Τέχνη Γραμματική_ of Dionysius Thrax was instrunmental in preserving the legacy of Aristarchus. 

In the first section of the _Τέχνη Γραμματική_, fittingly titled _Γραμματική_, Dionysius divides grammar into six components:

Translation:
First, practiced oral reading with regard to prosody
Second, explanation in accordance with the poetic figures
Third, accounting for words and background information
Fourth, discovery of etymologies
Fifth, setting out paradigms
Sixth, _krisis_ of the poems, which is the most beautiful aspect of the art
