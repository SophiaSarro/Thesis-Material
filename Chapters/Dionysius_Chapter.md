# Dionysius Thrax

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the _Τέχνη Γραμματική_ of Dionysius Thrax was instrunmental in preserving the legacy of Aristarchus. Much of this is due to the first section of the text, fittingly titled _Γραμματική_. Whereas the remainder of the text explains a variety of grammatical fundamentals, ranging from vowels and consonants to parts of speech, _Γραμματική_ outlines the six components of making a critical edition, which had only been undertaken by Zenodotus and Aristarchus so far. According to Dionysius, the six components of literary-criticism are as follows:

"First, practiced oral reading with regard to prosody

Second, explanation in accordance with the poetic figures

Third, accounting for words and background information

Fourth, discovery of etymologies

Fifth, setting out paradigms

Sixth, _krisis_ of the poems, which is the most beautiful aspect of the art"

While the order of the list is not arbitrary, the hopeful author of a critical edition did not necessarily have to be perform these tasks in precisely the order given. Instead, the list can be broken down into three steps - Practiced Oral Reading, Scholarly Work, and Krisis - wherein components within the same step can be performed in any order.

## Step One: Practiced Oral Reading

The first step of creating a critical edition only includes the first of Dionysius' six components. Before any work can be done in terms of understanding the poem, a scholar must first internalize every line, down to the breathings and pauses, and be able to recite them. The idea behind this is that anything "truly Homeric" would be perfect. If the words did not flow, or if the meter did not fit, a line could be assumed to be uh-Homeric. However, that judgement could not be made until the line was recited confidently and committed to memory. After all, if a scholar was not positive that his reading of the line was correct, then the fault for a line that did not flow properly may have been his, as opposed to the author's.

In the second section of _Τέχνη Γραμματική_, Dionysius breaks practiced oral reading down into three subcategories: delivery, prosody, and pauses. Delivery and pauses are more or less self-explanatory. Prosody, however, is a more ambiguous term, referring to the rhythmic patterns found in poetry. According to scholia found in manuscripts of _Τέχνη Γραμματική_, George Choiroboskos broke prosody into three subcategories, and then attributed these subcategories to Dionysius. These subcategories are tone, length, and breathing.

**Step Two: Scholarly Work**

The second step encompasses components two, three, four, and five from Dionysius' list. These components all contribute to making sure everything in the future critical edition is accurate, and therefore Homeric. While the step of scholarly work informs the subsequent step of krisis, it can also work backwards to inform the practiced oral reading. By setting out a paradigm or discovering an etymology, the understanding of a word's pronunciation may change, and a line which was once dubious may be vindicated. This is why scholarly work is the intermediate step. It comes after the scholar has a decent grasp of the text, but before any lines have been athetized, so that an informed decision on each line can eventually been made.

**Step Three: Krisis**

Dionysius' last remaining component, _krisis_, must be performed as a step of its own. _Krisis_ is the ancient Greek word for "judgement," and in this context refers to discerning whether a line is Homeric enough to be included in the critical edition. If a line was proven in the previous step to have coherent grammar, and not to be nonsensical or out-of-character, then it would be judged as truly Homeric and added to the addition. The lines containing mistakes would still be copied over into the critical edition, but would be marked with an obelos, as an indicator that readers should reject them. Aristonicus would later liken these obelized lines to dead bodies, lifeless but not physically gone. Dionysius did not phrase it quite as harshly, perhaps because obelization was not viewed as a death sentence by his teacher; indeed, Aristarchus had argued against Zenodotus' obelization of many lines, effectively bringing the lines back to life. While the step of krisis might be the harshest step, Dionysius also believed it to be the most beautiful, as trimming away the imperfect lines could allegedly reveal the truly Homeric text.
