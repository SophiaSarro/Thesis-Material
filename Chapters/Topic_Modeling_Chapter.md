While close reading of scholia is an integral facet of my research, as evidenced by the Verbal Adjective chapter, it does not need to be the only component. In prior decades, this would not be the case: research of scholia was limited to transcriptions and close readings, fit within the short span of time that a scholar could occupy space in a manuscript library. However, due to the recent digitization of the Venetus A manuscript, I can take advantage of a process called topic modeling and analyse scholia in a way other than close reading.
 
Topic modeling is a form of natural language processing which forms a statistical model of the “topics” which occur in any given corpus. A computer forms these “topics” by grouping the units - words or n-grams, depending on the model - which co-occur the most frequently. This process is known as text-mining, and allows scholars to discover recurring semantic structures throughout the corpus which would not otherwise be readily recognizeable. Additionally, the use of topic modeling allows me to make observations about the entire corpus of scholia in the Venetus A manuscript without doing a close reading of all 14,336 of them. While this task would almost certainly yield interesting results, it simply was not a feasible goal for one component of a year-long project.

Another advantage of topic modeling is that it yields empirical and replicable results. Anyone who wants to replicate or build off of the findings in this paper can use the lists of words included with this thesis*, as well as the stop words list, in order to get their own results. The stop words list is a collection of words which the computer is ordered to ignore when making its statistical models. For instance, articles and particles will appear evenly throughout the text regardless of context; for this reason, they are not important to include in the topic models, and thus are placed on the stop words list and filtered out. The different lists of words, meanwhile, display the different stages of topic modeling explored in this thesis. 

Additionally, each list can yield different results, depending on how it is divided. For the initial topic models of each list, the scholia were divided word by word - that is to say, each word constituted a unit. Subsequent topic models were constructed with n-grams, which are simply strings of words that appear next to each other. Topic models were made with both bi-grams (units consisting of two words) and tri-grams (units consisting of three words). While I was not initially sure if tri-grams would produce any meaningful results, or if clumping too many words together would obscure the meanings of the clusters, it was worth trying.

[Insert things about bi-grams and tri-grams, as soon as I know how to do that.]

Building off of the last chapter of this thesis, I also created topic models incorporating the verbal adjectives, and their co-occurence with the Aristarchan critical signs. As was previously established, the verbal adjectives tell what a scholar should do, according to the scholiast, when reading and analysing the texts. The critical signs serve a similar purpose, explaining the literary critics's thought process while creating a critical edition. Both the critical signs and the verbal adjectives point to literary-critical interests which were deemed important during the creation of the Venetus A. Thus, I wanted to see how these features of the text worked in tandem. I created a topic models of the scholia including verbal adjectives based on whether they were marked with a diple, a dotted diple, an asteriskos, or an obelos. (There are no scholia which contain a verbal adjective and are marked with an antisigma, a dotted antisigma, or a reverse dotted antisigma.) [I intend to create a topic model of all 869 scholia with verbal adjectives as a base to compare these topic models to, but have been unable to due to Observable not letting me see all of them.]

Of these topic models, I found it most telling to the "key" verbal adjectives of each category. In the diple topic models, διασταλτεον appears in the ten "key" words in seven out of fifteen topics. Στικτεον, γραπτεον, ακουστεον, παραιτητεον, περισπαστεον, προπερισπαστεον, ιστεον, αναγνωστεον, and εκληπτεον all appear in the key words of these fifteen topics as well. Notably, these words mainly fall into the Marking and Pronouncing category and the Scholarly Argument category of verbal adjectives. After finding this, I wondered if the other critical signs followed this pattern. I hypothesized that the obelos in particular would have more verbal adjectives from the Editorial Vocabulary category, as the obelos is used to show when a line has been judged un-Homeric. 

The dotted diple topic model followed the same pattern as the diple topic model, with διασταλτεον, ακουστεον, ρητεον, συσταλτεον, προπερισπαστεον, and προενεκτεον all showing up as key terms. Surprisingly to me, the obelos topic model did as well. The key words in the topics of the obelos-marked scholia include οξυτονητεον, περισπαστεον, στικτεον, μεταληπτεον, αναστρεπτεον, διασταλτεον, θετεον, ψιλωτεον, and γραπτεον. However, outside of the verbal adjectives, the obelos topic model was markedly different from the others. It was the only model to include forms of αθετεω (specifically, αθετειται and αθετουνται) as key words. It also included the word αστερισκοι as a key word, inherently connecting the obelos and asteriskos categories. This makes sense, as according to Aristonicus, the asteriskos is used to denote correctly-placed lines that are placed wrongly - and thus, are marked with an obelos - elsewhere in the text. The asteriskos topic model, however, does not include οβελοι as a key term, making this relationship seem rather one-sided.
