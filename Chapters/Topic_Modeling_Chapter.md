Section 1: Introduction
Recently, scholars in the humanities have embraced "topic modeling" - feeding a corpus into a computer, and allowing it to group the most frequently co-occurring terms into clusters. I'm so confused. Let's pretend that I have an intro paragraph here.

Section 2: Topic Models of Diplomatic Edition

When topic modeling the diplomatic edition, I have favored the results that come from sorting stuff into eighteen clusters. With this amount, clusters appear to have significance, without being too crammed with different topics or spread too thin. Even the overlap between clusters has been interesting. For instance, one of the clusters was as follows:

 >αρισταρχος ασκαλωνιτης εχει ομοιως τελους προς οξειαν αυτῳ βαρυνεται ευθειας
 
 While the other looked like this:
 
 >αρισταρχος ενθαδε εχει ζηνοδοτος μετρον ποιητῃ τρωων περισσος λεγειν ποτε
 
Clearly, these topics both center around Aristarchus. However, they do not feature him in the same light. Placing his name next to οξειαν, βαρυνεται, and ασκαλωνιτης, the former topic seems to highlight Aristarchus' marking/pronouncing comments. The latter topic, by juxtaposing his name with ζηνοδοτος, ποιητῃ, and λεγειν seems to suggest a cross-temporal discussion between the alleged Homer's work, what Zenodotus wrote, and what Aristarchus wrote in response.
