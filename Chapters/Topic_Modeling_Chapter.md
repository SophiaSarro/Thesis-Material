Intro to Topic Modeling:
While Homeric scholarship has been going on for thousands of years, recent technological advancements have allowed scholars to analyze the _Iliad_ as never before. One such advancement is the development of topic modeling, a method of statistical analysis in which words in a given corpus are arranged into topics based on the frequency of their co-occurrence. As counting the co-occurrences between every word in the scholia manually would take years, having a computer do it in a matter of seconds allows scholars to view patterns that may not have been visible before. 

Topic Modeling With All the Scholia:

The first step in our topic modeling journey was to topic model all of the words in the scholia, minus a select set we call "stop words." These stop words include articles, particles, and other words that appear in almost any context, so that tracking their co-occurences would be useless.
