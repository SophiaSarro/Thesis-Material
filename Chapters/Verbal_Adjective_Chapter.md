One might assume that, in order to study the Aristarchan tradition, a person would begin by examining the works of Aristarchus himself. However, like many pursuits in Classics, it is not that simple.  As Zenodotus’ successor as head of the Library of Alexandria, Aristarchus of Samothrace took it upon himself to expand upon and revise Zenodotus' fledgling field of Homeric criticism - seemingly because he disagreed with so much of his predecessor’s work. Along with debating whether lines obelized by Zenodotus were truly un-Homeric, Aristarchus also created more σημεῖον, including the ἀστερίσκος, σίγμα, and ἀντίσιγμα, in order to indicate duplicated, wrongfully athetized, and misplaced lines. According to the Suda, the 10th century text containing most extant biographical information about Aristarchus, Aristarchus "λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων." Unfortunately, this figure of eight hundred books cannot be verified, as most of Aristarchus’ corpus disappeared within a few generations of his death.

Thankfully for ancient and modern scholars alike, vestiges of Aristarchus’ teachings were preserved in the writings of his students. The grammarian Dionysius Thrax became an especially valuable source in terms of reverse-engineering Aristarchus’ work, as his work Τέχνη Γραμματική became the oldest surviving grammatical treatise. While it cannot be proven, I believe that the secret to Τέχνη Γραμματική’s survival lies in its vast applicability; the text acts as a very basic learner’s guide to Greek literature, covering fundamental topics such as verbs, adjectives, and meter. 

Another invaluable contributor to the continuation of Aristarchus’ legacy was Aristonicus of Alexandria, who contributed to this movement through his Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας. In Περὶ τῶν σημείων, Aristonicus explained the functions of the critical signs used. This was necessary as by the beginning of the first century, although the Aristarchan tradition was still alive and well, the source material it was based on was mostly gone. If grammarians were going to continue to use the σημεία as they were intended, they would need a non-Aristarchan source to tell them how.

Unfortunately, when trying to use his works as a gateway to Aristarchus, scholars studying Aristonicus face a similar roadblock - except this time, instead of the whole corpus going missing, Aristonicus’ work is only preserved in a singular page of the Venetus A manuscript of the Iliad. The page itself does not tell us much, save for the meanings of a few Aristarchan σημεία. Its inclusion in the Venetus A, conversely, provides a wealth of information on the Aristarchan tradition. Broadly, it means that as of the tenth century, when the Venetus A was written, scholars can conclude that Aristonicus’ work was still available and important enough to be replicated in some form. More specifically, the inclusion of the page in this particular manuscript means that this scribe valued what Aristonicus had to say about Aristarchus and his σημεία. Thus, the scholia of the Venetus A itself can be counted as part of the Aristarchan tradition of literary criticism, as the scholiast who copied them over evidently looked to Aristarchus as a model of how his job should be done.

As  a follower of the Aristarchan tradition, the scholiast of the Venetus A continued to provide scholars a wealth of information through his use of verbal adjectives. These words, identifiable by their -τεον endings, communicate a sense of necessity. Out of the seventy-six verbal adjectives included in the scholia, seventy four of them convey a direct command from the scholiast to his readers: “If one wants to follow the Aristarchan tradition (as I understand it ten centuries later), one must do this.” (The other two, namely [ADJECTIVES], refer to actions that must be performed within the context of the story itself.) Thus, by gathering and analyzing the verbal adjectives used throughout the scholia, a modern scholar can get a distant, yet still viable view of the Aristarchan tradition.

In this work, I aim to merge what we know of the Aristonican and Dionysian branches of the Aristarchan tradition by arranging the verbal adjectives according to components of literary criticism laid out in the Τέχνη Γραμματική. Specifically, when listing the six steps to thoroughly understanding a text, Dionysius begins with
