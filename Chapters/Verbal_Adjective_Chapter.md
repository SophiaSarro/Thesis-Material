One might assume that, in order to study the Aristarchan tradition, a person would begin by examining the works of Aristarchus himself. However, like many pursuits in Classics, it is not that simple.  As Zenodotus’ successor as head of the Library of Alexandria, Aristarchus of Samothrace took it upon himself to expand upon and revise Zenodotus' fledgling field of Homeric criticism - seemingly because he disagreed with so much of his predecessor’s work. Along with debating whether lines obelized by Zenodotus were truly un-Homeric, Aristarchus also created more σημεῖον, including the ἀστερίσκος, σίγμα, and ἀντίσιγμα, in order to indicate duplicated, wrongfully athetized, and misplaced lines. According to the Suda, the 10th century text containing most extant biographical information about Aristarchus, Aristarchus "λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων." Unfortunately, this figure of eight hundred books cannot be verified, as most of Aristarchus’ corpus disappeared within a few generations of his death.
Thankfully for ancient and modern scholars alike, vestiges of Aristarchus’ teachings were preserved in the writings of his students. The grammarian Dionysius Thrax became an especially valuable source in terms of reverse-engineering Aristarchus’ work, as his work Τέχνη Γραμματική became the oldest surviving grammatical treatise. While it cannot be proven, I believe that the secret to Τέχνη Γραμματική’s survival lies in its vast applicability; the text acts as a very basic learner’s guide to Greek literature, covering fundamental topics such as verbs, adjectives, and meter. [Add more here].
As of the late first century BCE, when his students were no longer around to carry on his teachings, the movement to reconstruct Aristarchus' works had begun. Aristonicus of Alexandria contributed to this movement through his Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας, which explained the functions of the critical signs used by Aristarchus. His non-Aristarchan works, Περὶ τῆς Μενελάου πλάνης and ἀσυντάκτων ὀνομάτων βιβλία, unfortunately did not survive; however, once the world had a second chance to preserve the Aristarchan tradition, it would not go to waste; one page of Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας was preserved in the Venetus A manuscript of the Iliad, confirming that Aristonicus' work on Aristarchus was still being actively replicated as of the tenth century CE. The Venetus A manuscript itself represents the final step of the Aristarchan tradition's evolution: having moved far beyond the inner circle of scholars in the Library of Alexandria, the tradition was adopted and altered by scribes for their own purposes. Some Homeric scribes, such as the one who wrote the Venetus A manuscript, kept Aristarchus' system more or less as it was presented by Aristonicus. Other manuscripts, such as the grammatical treatise attributed to Suetonius, combined the Aristarchan σημεῖα with other signs in order to adapt them for a non-Homeric context. Thus, a literary tradition which was almost lost became one of the longest-lasting and most recognizeable systems for literary criticism.
>ΠΕΡΙ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΙΚΗΣ.
>Γραμματική ἐστιν ἐμπειρία τῶν παρὰ ποιηταῖς τε καὶ συγγραφεῦσιν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ λεγομένων. Μέρη δὲ αὐτῆς εἰσὶν ἕξ· πρῶτον ἀνάγνωσις ἐντριβὴς κατὰ προσῳδίαν, >δεύτερον ἐξήγησις κατὰ τοὺς ἐνυπάρχοντας ποιητικοὺς τρόπους, τρίτον γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἱστοριῶν πρόχειρος ἀπόδοσις, τέταρτον ἐτυμολογίας εὕρεσις, πέμπτον ἀναλογίας >ἐκλογισμός, ἕκτον κρίσις ποιημάτων, ὃ δὴ κάλλιστόν ἐστι πάντων τῶν ἐν τῇ τέχνῃ.
Dionysius' first rule states that a grammarian must be proficient in ανάγνωσίς (anagnosis). In the specific context of literary criticism, ανάγνωσίς refers to reading the text aloud. Before a grammarian can fully understand a text, or even progress to the next steps towards understanding, Dionysius asserts that they must be able to recite the text orally. In the second section, he elaborates that reading aloud ensures that the grammarian is familiar with the tone, prosody, and pauses (καθ᾽ ὑπόκρισιν, κατὰ προσῳδίαν, κατὰ διαστολήν), as well as with the words themselves.
From the seventy-four verbal adjectives of interest, I have made three main categories: Marking/Pronouncing, Scholarly Argument, and Editorial Vocabulary. Of these three, only the Marking/Pronouncing category maps neatly onto Dionysius' methodology; specifically, every verbal adjective under that category corresponds with Dionysius' first rule. Interestingly, both Dionysius and the Venetus A scholiast seem to hold this step of the process in high regard. Whereas Dionysius showed its importance by placing it first in his list, the Venetus A scholiast conveyed the same idea by using eighteen separate verbal adjectives to say "one must the text correctly."  Notably, the scholiast also touches upon all three of Dionysius' criteria for a proper reading (ὑπόκρισιν, προσῳδίαν, and διαστολήν) as well as adding a fouth category, aspiration.
In terms of reading aloud, the Venetus A scribe pays a disproportionate amount of attention to accentuation. This makes sense, as by the Byzantine period, tonal accents had been phased out of spoken Greek. However, as "accentuation deserves as much attention as any other feature, if the attempt is made to accustom the ear to the sound of a language," a scholar could not hope to effectively read the Iliad - and thus, to analyze it - unless the accents were in their proper places (Sealey 1963). [COME BACK TO THIS] By Dionysius' time, scholars believe that tonal accents were already starting to disappear. Therefore, it would be imperative for his readers to read the Iliad aloud, instead of silently, in order to fully grasp the tonality of the text. Similarly, the Venetus A scholiast..
