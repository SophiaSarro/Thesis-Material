Introduction to the Verbal Adjective:

When studying the literary-critical interests of a scholiast, it only makes sense to do a close reading of the scholia he wrote. However, as the Venetus A manuscript houses 14,336 scholia, I could not hope to read and analyze and sort all of them as just one part of a one-year project. If I wanted to accomplish anything, I first had to select a group of scholia to focus on - the question was, which group of scholia would yield meaningful results?

The idea to analyze scholia containing verbal adjectives stemmed from their conspicuous abundance. Verbal adjectives - words ending in _-τέον_ - appear very infrequently in the larger Greek corpus. The Venetus A scholiast, however, employed an impressive 78 verbal adjectives in his scholia. Only two of these verbal adjectives - φυλακτεον and - are used in the context of what characters of the _Iliad_ must do in the story. The remaining 76 verbal adjectives are used to instruct readers on how they should interpret the text. This ratio of 2:76 demonstrates that when talking about a subject other than his literary-critical interests, the scholiast does not use verbal adjectives noticeably more frequently than any other writer; when talking about his literary-critical interests, however, he uses them far more frequently. As verbal adjectives have a special literary-critical significance to the Venetus A scholiast, there seemed to be no better group of scholia to examine than those containing verbal adjectives. 

Momentarily, it seemed that I had isolated the perfect group of scholia to focus on. Any contentment I had was quashed by the revelation that there are over 800 scholia containing verbal adjectives in the Venetus A. While I could have sifted through these scholia at random, hoping to stumble across something of meaning, I figured that there must have been a more organized and effective way. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of material I was dealing with, and groping for any semblance of a direction, I began sorting the verbal adjectives into tables.

While the table went through several iterations, I eventually settled on dividing it into three categories: those having to do with marking for proper pronunciation, those used to make a scholarly argument, and technical vocabulary only used in the context of literary criticism. Even this categorization, as neat as it was, seemed hopelessly arbitrary - until I realized that Dionysius Thrax's six components of literary criticism can be sorted into the same three categories. The distribution is as follows:

Oral Reading:

First, practiced oral reading with regard to prosody

Scholarly Work:

Second, explanation in accordance with the poetic figures
Third, accounting for words and background information
Fourth, discovery of etymologies
Fifth, setting out paradigms

Editorial Work:

Sixth, krisis of the poems, which is the most beautiful aspect of the art

Confirming that this categorization is not arbitrary, each of the three categories counts as a distinct phase in the creation of a critical edition. That is to say, Dionysius' first component, the only component in the Oral Reading category, has to take place before any of the others. Upon moving to the Scholarly Work category, a grammarian could perform any of the four components therein in any order. All four of them must be completed, however, until the scholar can move onto krisis, the only step in the Editorial Work category. 

Oral Reading:

The similarities, however, do not end there. Dionysius further breaks down the process of _ἀνάγνωσις_ into three separate categories: delivery (_ὑπόκρισιν_), prosody (_προσῳδίαν_), and pauses (_διαστολήν_). The latter two categories can be, and frequently are, alluded to by the Venetus A scholiast as well. In his commentary on Dionysius, George Choroboskos claimed that prosody can be further broken down into three categories: tone, length, and breathing. All three of these appear as concerns of the Venetus A scholiast, as evidenced by Table B. In fact, the only facet of _ἀνάγνωσις_ that the scholiast overlooks is delivery (_ὑπόκρισιν_). This would definitely be the hardest to communicate in a written format. Dionysius, by divorcing his work from any given edition of the _Iliad_, gave himself the freedom to go as in-depth as he desires with basic concepts such as _ὑπόκρισιν_; however, just as the Venetus A scholiast would not pause to explain what a vowel is, like Dionysius does, he likewise cannot pause in the many things he has to do in order to explain something as tangentially related to the source material as proper delivery.

Item 4:
ἵστεον ὅτι ὁ ποιητὴς πανταχοῦ τὸ ὁμοίϊον ἐπι τοῦ φαύλου λαμβάνει οἷον ὡς ἐνταῦθα ἀλλά σε γήρας τειρει ὁμοιΐον . καὶ ἀλλ ἥτοι θάνατον μὲν ὁμοίϊον οὐδὲ θεοί περ ἢμι φίλω· ἀνδρὶ δύνανται ἀλαλκέμεν ὁπότ ἂν τελος ἔλθῃ ὁμοίϊον πτολέμοιο·
Commenting on Iliad 4.315

One must understand that the poet always uses the word ομοιϊον in a negative sense. (Examples quoted)”
(Commenting on Iliad 4.315)

Item 5:
“ἔχθιστος δ’ Ἀχιλῆϊ . ὅτι Ζηνοδοτος τοῦτον καὶ τοὺς μετ αυτὸν τρεῖς ἡθέτηκεν προς ὑπόθεσιν δέ τινα λέγονται επίτηδες γὰρ τούτων τῶν αγαθῶν ἐπεσβόλον παραγείοχεν : ἱστέον δὲ ὅτι Ἀχιλλεὺς αὐτον ἀναιρεῖ ὡς ἱστορεῖ Κόϊντος ὁ ποιητὴς ἐν τοῖς μεθ Ὅμηρον φησὶ γὰρ ὅτι ἐν τῇ Ἀμαζονομαχια ἀνελὼν ὁ Ἀχιλλεὺς Πενθεσίλειαν τὴν τῶν Ἀμαζόνων βασίλισσαν ὕστερον προσχὼν τὸ σῶμα αὐτης εὐπρεπὲς πάνυ εἰς ἔρωτα ἤλθεν τῆς προειρημενης βαρέως τὲ ἔφερεν ἐπι τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτῆς : ὁρῶν δὲ δυσφοροῦντα αὐτὸν Θερσίτης συνήθως ἐλοιδόρει . ἐφ ῷ ὀργισθεις ὁ ἤρως γρονθω παίσας αὐτὸν ἀναιρεῖ παραυτὰ τῶν οδοντῶν αὐτοῦ ἐνεχθεντων χαμαί”
Commenting on Iliad 2.220

The sign is there because Zenodotus athetized this line and the following three...
It must be understood that Achilles kills him as Quintus the poet says in Τα Μετα Ὅμηρον...”
(Commenting on Iliad 2.220)

Item 6:
“Δασυντέον, τὸ γὰρ α προ τοῦ δ ὃν καὶ μὴ έχον στερητικὴν ἔννοιαν ῆ κρᾶσιν τινὰ δασύνεσθαι θέλει , στερητικὴν μὲν οὕτως . κατα κράσιν ἀδαής , ἀδρανής ἀδευκής , μὴ ουτ δὲ ἔχον ἁδρός ἀδινός Ἀδριας δι ὃ καὶ τὸ Ἅδωνις κρεῖττον ἐστι δασύνειν ἵνα καὶ παρα τῷ αἴδειν τῇ δαίμονι ἐτυμολογηθ”
Commenting on Iliad 11.88

“One must put a rough breathing, since the α before the δ tends to have a rough breathing when it does not have a negative sense or does not have krasis. Krasis makes the breathing smooth in ἀδαής and ἀδρανής, but makes it rough in ἁδρός, ἀδινός, and Ἀδριας. For this reason it is better to put a rough breathing on  Ἅδωνις (since people put a smooth breathing on it) because they take the etymology from αἴδειν τῇ δαίμονι.”

Commenting on Iliad 8.191

“[The critical sign is here] because he uses the dual form in reference to two items. For this reason, one must athetize the previous line in which there are four names.”
