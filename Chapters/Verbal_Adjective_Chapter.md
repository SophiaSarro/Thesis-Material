Ideally, when studying the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition, one would begin by studying Aristarchus. While working as Zenodotus’ successor as head of the Library of Alexandria, Aristarchus of Samothrace took it upon himself to expand upon and revise Zenodotus' fledgling field of Homeric criticism - seemingly because he disagreed with so much of his predecessor’s work. Along with debating whether lines obelized by Zenodotus were truly un-Homeric, Aristarchus also created more _σημεῖα_, including the _ἀστερίσκος_, _σίγμα_, and _ἀντίσιγμα_, in order to indicate duplicated, wrongfully athetized, and misplaced lines. According to the Suda, the 10th century text containing most extant biographical information about Aristarchus, Aristarchus "_λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων_." Unfortunately, this figure of eight hundred books cannot be verified, as most of Aristarchus’ corpus disappeared within a few generations of his death. This marks the first obstruction in studying the Aristarchan tradition; barring the miraculous discovery of a text, one cannot begin studying from the most logical starting point.

Thankfully for ancient and modern scholars alike, vestiges of Aristarchus’ teachings were preserved in the writings of his students. The grammarian Dionysius Thrax became an especially valuable source in terms of reverse-engineering Aristarchus’ work, as his work _Τέχνη Γραμματική_ became the oldest surviving grammatical treatise. While it cannot be proven, I believe that the secret to _Τέχνη Γραμματική_ ’s survival lies in its vast applicability; the text acts as a very basic learner’s guide to Greek literature, covering fundamental topics such as verbs, adjectives, and meter. 

Another invaluable contributor to the continuation of Aristarchus’ legacy was Aristonicus of Alexandria, who contributed to this movement through his _Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_. In _Περὶ τῶν σημείων_, Aristonicus explained the functions of the critical signs used. This was necessary as by the beginning of the first century, although the Aristarchan tradition was still alive and well, the source material it was based on was mostly gone. If grammarians were going to continue to use the _σημεία_ as Aristarchus intended, they would need a non-Aristarchan source to tell them how.

Unfortunately, when trying to use his works as a gateway to Aristarchus, scholars studying Aristonicus face a similar roadblock - except this time, instead of the whole corpus going missing, Aristonicus’ work is only preserved in a singular page of the Venetus A manuscript of the Iliad. The page itself does not tell us much, save for the meanings of a few Aristarchan _σημεία_. Its inclusion in the Venetus A, conversely, provides a wealth of information on the Aristarchan tradition. Broadly, it means that as of the tenth century, when the Venetus A was written, scholars can conclude that Aristonicus’ work was still available and important enough to be replicated in some form. More specifically, the inclusion of the page in this particular manuscript means that this scribe valued what Aristonicus had to say about Aristarchus and his _σημεία_. 

Another valuable source is George Choiroboskos, a 9th century grammarian who carried on the Aristarchan tradition by studying the works of Dionysius Thrax.

Thus, even though the works of Aristarchus were long lost by the tenth century, the scholiast of the Venetus A manuscript was not lacking in sources. His frequent namedropping of Aristonicus and Dionysius Thrax implied that he had access to both of their texts. While George Choiroboskos is not mentioned directly, his analysis of Dionysius Thrax was only a matter of decades old when the scholiast was working. It makes sense that, even if Choiroboskos' works themselves were not used, the scholiast would have been exposed to similar ideas as part of the grammatical zeitgeist. Thus, the scholia of the Venetus A itself can be counted as part of the Aristarchan tradition of literary criticism.

As  a follower of the Aristarchan tradition, the scholiast of the Venetus A continued to provide scholars a wealth of information through his use of verbal adjectives. These words, identifiable by their _-τέον_ endings, communicate a sense of necessity. Out of the seventy-six verbal adjectives included in the scholia, seventy four of them convey a direct command from the scholiast to his readers: “If one wants to follow the Aristarchan tradition (as I understand it ten centuries later), one must do this.” (The other two, namely _πολεμητέον_ and _φυλακτέον_, refer to actions that must be performed within the context of the story itself.) Thus, by gathering and analyzing the verbal adjectives used throughout the scholia, a modern scholar can get a distant, yet still viable view of the Aristarchan tradition.

In this thesis, I aim to merge what we know of the Aristonican and Dionysian branches of the Aristarchan tradition by arranging the verbal adjectives according to components of literary criticism laid out in the _Τέχνη Γραμματική_. When listing the six steps to thoroughly understanding a text, Dionysius begins with _ἀνάγνωσις_, the act of reading aloud. Only once a scholar has internalized the spoken nuances of the text, he argues, can they progress to the next stages of literary analysis. Without cross-referencing it with the Venetus A, we may have assumed that this disporopotionate concern for reading aloud was purely a [concern] of Dionysius. However, the Venetus A scholiast also shares this concern. Eighteen out of his seventy-four relevant verbal adjectives - or an impressive 24.32% - pertain to reading aloud. As the concern shows up in both Dionysius' and Aristonicus' respective veins of the Aristarchan tradition, it is reasonable to conclude that it stems back to Aristarchus himself.

The similarities, however, do not end there. Dionysius further breaks down the process of _ἀνάγνωσις_ into three separate categories: tone (_ὑπόκρισιν_), prosody (_προσῳδίαν_), and pauses (_διαστολήν_). As evidenced by Table B, all three of these concerns arise in the Venetus A scholia as well. It seems reasonable that this teaching, too, stemmed back from Aristarchus. In addition to these three components of _ἀνάγνωσις_, the scholiast adds a fouth: aspiration. Despite writing a fairly comprehensive guide to pronunciation, breaking down words to the letter and then categorizing those letters, not once does he mention smooth or rough breathing marks. Historically, this makes sense. Scholars have traced the breathing marks back to Aristophanes of Byzantium, a contemporary of Aristarchus who died roughly a decade before Dionysius' birth. Thus, while marking aspiration was possible during Aristarchus' time, it was by no means mandatory. However, by the 10th century, when the Venetus A scholiast was writing, it had become standard practice to include aspiration marks due to the growing disparity between orthography and pronunciation. While concern towards tone, prosody, and pauses can all be traced back to Aristarchus, the fixation with proper aspiration is unique to the Venetus A scholiast in this context.

While the other sections of Table A do not map onto Dionysius' methodology quite as neatly, they do illustrate the same progression from the most basic to mose "beautiful" aspects of literary criticism. The words in the Marking/Pronouncing category, as we have already established, are the fundamentals of understanding the text. Notably, most of these words can only be used in the grammatical context. The next section of the table, words used to compose a Scholarly Argument, is admittedly more broad. Words such as _θετέον_, _νομιστέον_, and _ἀρκτέον_ show up in many contexts outside of literary criticism. In order to ascend to the tier of understanding the text fully, as soon as one has internalized the text itself, one must understand how a logical argument works. Finally, once these two steps are taken care of, the scholar reaches the phase of Editorial Vocabulary - words that, like those in the Marking/Pronouncing categories, have very niche meanings tied intrinsically to their literary-critical use. This expansion and contraction of specificity aligns nicely with Dionysius' methodology. 

Admittedly, this is far from a comprehensive survey of Aristarchus' main concerns. However, considering that virtually none of his writing remains, it is significant to be able to pinpoint any of Aristarchus' concerns at all. By comparing the interests of Dionysius Thrax to those of the Venetus A scholiast, who in turn was influenced by Aristonicus, we can deduce that the common fixation on tone, prosody, and pauses was originally Aristarchan.
