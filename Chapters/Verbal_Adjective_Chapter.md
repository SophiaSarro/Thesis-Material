Introduction to the Verbal Adjective:
When studying the literary-critical interests of a scholiast, it only makes sense to do a close reading of the scholia he wrote. However, as the Venetus A manuscript houses 14,336 scholia, I could not hope to read and analyze and sort all of them as just one part of a one-year project. If I wanted to accomplish anything, I first had to select a group of scholia to focus on - the question was, which group?

When listing the six steps to thoroughly understanding a text, Dionysius begins with _ἀνάγνωσις_, the act of reading aloud. Only once a scholar has internalized the spoken nuances of the text, he argues, can they progress to the next stages of literary analysis. Without cross-referencing it with the Venetus A, we may have assumed that this disporopotionate concern for reading aloud was purely a concern of Dionysius. However, the Venetus A scholiast also shares this concern. Eighteen out of his seventy-four relevant verbal adjectives - or an impressive 24.32% - pertain to reading aloud. As the concern shows up in both Dionysius' and Aristonicus' respective veins of the Aristarchan tradition, it is reasonable to conclude that it stems back to Aristarchus himself.

The similarities, however, do not end there. Dionysius further breaks down the process of _ἀνάγνωσις_ into three separate categories: delivery (_ὑπόκρισιν_), prosody (_προσῳδίαν_), and pauses (_διαστολήν_). The latter two categories can be, and frequently are, alluded to by the Venetus A scholiast as well. In his commentary on Dionysius, George Choroboskos claimed that prosody can be further broken down into three categories: tone, length, and breathing. All three of these appear as concerns of the Venetus A scholiast, as evidenced by Table B. In fact, the only facet of _ἀνάγνωσις_ that the scholiast overlooks is delivery (_ὑπόκρισιν_). This would definitely be the hardest to communicate in a written format. Dionysius, by divorcing his work from any given edition of the _Iliad_, gave himself the freedom to go as in-depth as he desires with basic concepts such as _ὑπόκρισιν_; however, just as the Venetus A scholiast would not pause to explain what a vowel is, like Dionysius does, he likewise cannot pause in the many things he has to do in order to explain something as tangentially related to the source material as proper delivery.

The second category, Scholarly Work, encompasses Dionysius' second, third, fourth, and fifth steps.
