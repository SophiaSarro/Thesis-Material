As  a follower of the Aristarchan tradition, the scholiast of the Venetus A continued to provide scholars a wealth of information through his use of verbal adjectives. These words, identifiable by their _-τέον_ endings, communicate a sense of necessity. Out of the seventy-six verbal adjectives included in the scholia, seventy four of them convey a direct command from the scholiast to his readers: “If one wants to follow the Aristarchan tradition (as I understand it ten centuries later), one must do this.” (The other two, namely _πολεμητέον_ and _φυλακτέον_, refer to actions that must be performed within the context of the story itself.) Thus, by gathering and analyzing the verbal adjectives used throughout the scholia, a modern scholar can get a distant, yet still viable view of the Aristarchan tradition.

This thesis does not aim to provide a full survey of the extant works of Dionysius Thrax, Aristonicus, and George Choiroboskos. Instead, it aims to highlight the Venetus A as a converging point for these branches of the Aristarchan tradition, and to illucidate the Venetus A's connection with each. When listing the six steps to thoroughly understanding a text, Dionysius begins with _ἀνάγνωσις_, the act of reading aloud. Only once a scholar has internalized the spoken nuances of the text, he argues, can they progress to the next stages of literary analysis. Without cross-referencing it with the Venetus A, we may have assumed that this disporopotionate concern for reading aloud was purely a concern of Dionysius. However, the Venetus A scholiast also shares this concern. Eighteen out of his seventy-four relevant verbal adjectives - or an impressive 24.32% - pertain to reading aloud. As the concern shows up in both Dionysius' and Aristonicus' respective veins of the Aristarchan tradition, it is reasonable to conclude that it stems back to Aristarchus himself.

The similarities, however, do not end there. Dionysius further breaks down the process of _ἀνάγνωσις_ into three separate categories: delivery (_ὑπόκρισιν_), prosody (_προσῳδίαν_), and pauses (_διαστολήν_). The latter two categories can be, and frequently are, alluded to by the Venetus A scholiast as well. In his commentary on Dionysius, George Choroboskos claimed that prosody can be further broken down into three categories: tone, length, and breathing. All three of these appear as concerns of the Venetus A scholiast, as evidenced by Table B. In fact, the only facet of _ἀνάγνωσις_ that the scholiast overlooks is delivery (_ὑπόκρισιν_). This would definitely be the hardest to communicate in a written format. Dionysius, by divorcing his work from any given edition of the _Iliad_, gave himself the freedom to go as in-depth as he desires with basic concepts such as _ὑπόκρισιν_; however, just as the Venetus A scholiast would not pause to explain what a vowel is, like Dionysius does, he likewise cannot pause in the many things he has to do in order to explain something as tangentially related to the source material as proper delivery.

The second category, Scholarly Work, encompasses Dionysius' second, third, fourth, and fifth steps.
