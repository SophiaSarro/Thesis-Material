Through close readings of the scholia and topic modeling, I identified many literary-critical interests shared between the Venetus A scholiast and the earlier followers of the Aristarchan tradition.  This finding suggests that the Venetus A scholiast took much inspiration from the followers of Aristarchus, and explain's the choice of having _On the Critical Signs of the Iliad and the Odyssey_ at the front of the manuscript.
