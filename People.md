Before exploring the development, transmission, and appropriation of Aristarchan critical signs, it is important to establish how certain key figures contributed to their development and preservation. Just as Aristarchus and company took a critical approach to examining the _Iliad_, we as scholars must approach these critical works exegetically. 

Zenodotus of Ephesus, who lived during the 3rd century BCE, was the first superintendant of the Library of Alexandria. His critical work on Homer inspired an entire literary tradition - seemingly because his successor, Aristarchus, disagreed with so much of it. Zenodotus took it upon himself to athetize lines of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ that he thought were un-Homeric. Interestingly, he also edited Hesiod's _Theogony_. 

He notably composed a list called the γλωσσαι of irregular words to supplement his scholarship. This seems similar to the Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι written by his teacher, Philitas of Cos. 

Aristarchus of Samothrace lived between 216 BCE and 144 BCE (Schironi, 5, 1). While he is currently known as being "φύσει Σαμοθρᾴξ," Aristarchus lived most of his life in Alexandria, where he taught upwards of forty students and followed Zenodotus as the superintendant of the Library of Alexandria. 

The Suda, a 10th century document [...], claims that Aristarchus "λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων." Unfortunately, this figure of eight hundred books cannot be verified, as none of Aristarchus' works are extant today. In fact, just a few generations after his death, literary scholars were already scrambling to reconstruct his works. The question is, if Aristarchus' works were mostly gone within a few generations, why did future grammarians _want_ to reconstruct his works? Who had convinced them that his works were worth saving?

Towards the end of his life, Aristarchus was most likely either exiled by Ptolomy Physcon, or exiled himself to avoid a similar fate. Thus, Aristarchus joined the growing Alexandrian diaspora of scholars evicted from the [kingdom] once Ptolemy Physcon usurped the throne and became Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II. One might assume that as he fled his homeland, Aristarchus would spread his works throughout his new home of Cyprus, preserving it for a new audience. However, this was not the case. Aristarchus wrote for a particularly niche audience - namely, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria - and once he disappeared from Alexandria, so did his works. 

With the works of Aristarchus disappearing from the earth, and their originator dead from "starvation" and "an excess of fluids in the body tissue," it would seem logical for the Aristarchan tradition to die along with him. However, subsequent scholars would not give up on Aristarchus so easily. Within a few generations of his death, in fact, scholars were already scrambling to piece back together what little information remained.

The answer, of course, would be those forty-some students referenced by the Suda. Specifically, his student Dionysius Thrax (170-90 BCE) became one of the best-remembered grammarians of his time, as his work _The Art of the Grammarian_ outlasted Aristarchus' corpus by far and still exists (in a probably abridged form) today.

Based on his one surviving work, The Art of the Grammarian, Dionysius took a different approach to scholarship than the aforementioned grammarians. Whereas they integrated their critiques into editions of the _Iliad_, or based separate works upon those editions (see: Zenodotus' Glossai), the Art of the Grammarian is far less intertwined with the subject matter. He does mention Homeric work periodically, such as when he explains the origins of the word ραπσοδιαν, or when he explains the of Achilles' patronymic. Unlike later grammarians, Dionysius saw no need to replicate Aristarchus' works and fill in the many gaps. 

Aristonicus of Alexandria was a Homeric scholar who lived between the late first century BCE and early first century CE. (I can't find the exact years for some reason. Come back to that.) He wrote Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας, which explained the uses of the critical signs used by Aristarchus. This work does not exist in full, but a page, thought to be in a minimally altered state from the original, survived in the Venetus A manuscript of the _Iliad_.

Aristonicus not only [not copied, not took inspiration from, something else] Aristarchus in terms of subject matter, but also in the close link between his text and the source material.  _Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας_, unlike _Τεχνη Γραμματικη_, is a piece entirely constructed around Homeric poems, and which cannot be divorced from them.
