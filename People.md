Zenodotus:



Aristarchus:

"Aristarchus of Samothrace (216–144 BCE) is the most famous Alexandrian grammarian and one of the most important scholars of antiquity" (Schironi, xvii, 0.1).

* QUOTE FROM THE SUDA: "Su. α 3892 Ἀρίσταρχος: Ἀλεξανδρεὺς θέσει, τῇ δὲ φύσει Σαμοθρᾴξ, πατρὸς Ἀριστάρχου. γέγονε δὲ κατὰ τὴν ρνϛʹ Ὀλυμπιάδα, ἐπὶ Πτολεμαίου τοῦ Φιλομήτορος, οὗ καὶ τὸν υἱὸν ἐπαίδευσε. λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων. μαθητὴς δὲ γέγονεν Ἀριστοφάνους τοῦ γραμματικοῦ καὶ Κράτητι τῷ γραμματικῷ Περγαμηνῷ πλεῖστα διημιλλήσατο ἐν Περγάμῳ. μαθηταὶ δὲ αὐτοῦ γραμματικοὶ περὶ τοὺς μʹ ἐγένοντο. τελευτᾷ δὲ ἐν Κύπρῳ
ἑαυτὸν ὑπεξαγαγὼν ἐνδείᾳ τροφῆς, νόσῳ τῇ ὕδρωπι ληφθείς. ἔτη δὲ αὐτοῦ τῆς ζωῆς οβʹ. καὶ παῖδας μὲν κατέλιπεν Ἀρίσταρχον καὶ Ἀρισταγόραν. ἄμφω δὲ ἐγένοντο εὐήθεις, ὥστε καὶ ἐπράθη ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος· Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ἐλθόντα παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἐξωνήσαντο." - GO BACK OVER THIS. THERE IS SOMETHING HERE (Schironi, 3-4, 1) 
 * What am I even thinking? Is it that his biographical info was so well-preserved, but his actual works weren't?? The Suda in particular is from the 10th c CE. People literal centuries into the future knew all this, down to his father's name and the age at which he died, and yet people just a few centuries after him were struggling to reconstruct his works.
 * In other news, _he starved himself to death_?? Because he had "an excess of watery fluid collecting in the cavities or tissues of the body" (per Google's definition of dropsy)??? That's a lot to take in.

* Important: Zenodotus wrote the γλωσσαι, which is allegedly a formal list of unusual words that later scholars used when they cited Zenodotus. When Dionysius Thrax  wrote his third point, about γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἱστοριῶν, was he referencing Zenodotus' list in particular?
