Before exploring the development, transmission, and appropriation of Aristarchan critical signs, it is important to establish how certain key figures contributed to their development and preservation. Just as Aristarchus and company took a critical approach to examining the _Iliad_, we as scholars must approach these critical works exegetically. 

Zenodotus:

Zenodotus of Ephesus, who lived during the 3rd century BCE, was the first superintendant of the Library of Alexandria. His critical work on Homer inspired an entire literary tradition - seemingly because his successor, Aristarchus, disagreed with so much of it. Zenodotus took it upon himself to athetize lines of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ that he thought were un-Homeric. Interestingly, he also edited Hesiod's _Theogony_. 

He notably composed a list called the γλωσσαι of irregular words to supplement his scholarship. This seems similar to the Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι written by his teacher, Philitas of Cos. 

Aristarchus:

Aristarchus of Samothrace lived between 216 BCE and 144 BCE (Schironi, 5, 1). He allegedly taught about forty students, including Ptolemy Physcon and possibly other members of the Ptolemy family. Thus, he had many people to pass on his literary teachings after he died. 

Aristarchus' works are preserved in fragment form in the works of other writers. His works ceased to exist shortly after his death, so that "[within] a few generations after his death, his successors at Alexandria were desperately trying to reconstruct and preserve his work" (Schironi, 7, 1). This is partially because his works were not intended for a large audience. Instead, they were composed for other scholars in the Library of Alexandria to use.

Aristarchus allegedly died in Cyprus, possibly in exile. As Ptolemy Physcon exiled scholarly contemporaries of Aristarchus upon usurping the throne and becoming Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, it is likely that his former student exiled him (Schironi, 5, 1). However, that is not definitive - "Athenaeus, our source for these events, only remarks that under Ptolemy VIII many intellectuals left Alexandria and settled on islands and in cities of the Mediterranean, and that this intellectual ‘diaspora’ spread Alexandrian culture throughout the Mediterranean, giving rise to a new cultural renaissance outside of Egypt" (Schironi, 5, 1).

Dionysius Thrax:

Based on his one surviving work, The Art of the Grammarian, Dionysius took a different approach to scholarship than the aforementioned grammarians. Whereas they integrated their critiques into editions of the _Iliad_, or based separate works upon those editions (see: Zenodotus' Glossai), the Art of the Grammarian is far less intertwined with the subject matter. He does mention Homeric work periodically, such as when he explains the origins of the word ραπσοδιαν, or when he explains the of Achilles' patronymic. However, compared to Aristarchus and Zenodotus, Dionysius Thrax c

Aristonicus:

Aristonicus of Alexandria was a Homeric scholar who lived between the late first century BCE and early first century CE. (I can't find the exact years for some reason. Come back to that.) He wrote Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας, which explained the uses of the critical signs used by Aristarchus. This work does not exist in full, but a page, thought to be in a minimally altered state from the original, survived in the Venetus A manuscript of the _Iliad_.
