[Aristarchus:]
Aristarchus lived between 216 BCE and 144 BCE (Schironi, 5, 1). He 
"Aristarchus of Samothrace (216–144 BCE) is the most famous Alexandrian grammarian and one of the most important scholars of antiquity" (Schironi, xvii, 0.1). He allegedly taught about forty students, including Ptolemy Physcon and possibly other members of the Ptolemy family. Thus, he had many people to pass on his literary teachings after he died. 

This is what Aristarchus wrote during his life.

Aristarchus allegedly died in Cyprus, possibly in exile. As Ptolemy Physcon exiled scholarly contemporaries of Aristarchus upon usurping the throne and becoming Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, it is likely that his former student exiled him (Schironi, 5, 1). However, that is not definitive - "Athenaeus, our source for these events, only remarks that under Ptolemy VIII many intellectuals left Alexandria and settled on islands and in cities of the Mediterranean, and that this intellectual ‘diaspora’ spread Alexandrian culture throughout the Mediterranean, giving rise to a new cultural renaissance outside of Egypt" (Schironi, 5, 1). ***Aside from just rehashing Schironi, this section does have a point. Or at least it raises a question. Did this diasporic spread indirectly lead to the Aristarchan tradition ending up in Byzantium? Or was it transmitted in other ways?***

* QUOTE FROM THE SUDA: "Su. α 3892 Ἀρίσταρχος: Ἀλεξανδρεὺς θέσει, τῇ δὲ φύσει Σαμοθρᾴξ, πατρὸς Ἀριστάρχου. γέγονε δὲ κατὰ τὴν ρνϛʹ Ὀλυμπιάδα, ἐπὶ Πτολεμαίου τοῦ Φιλομήτορος, οὗ καὶ τὸν υἱὸν ἐπαίδευσε. λέγεται δὲ γράψαι ὑπὲρ ωʹ βιβλία ὑπομνημάτων μόνων. μαθητὴς δὲ γέγονεν Ἀριστοφάνους τοῦ γραμματικοῦ καὶ Κράτητι τῷ γραμματικῷ Περγαμηνῷ πλεῖστα διημιλλήσατο ἐν Περγάμῳ. μαθηταὶ δὲ αὐτοῦ γραμματικοὶ περὶ τοὺς μʹ ἐγένοντο. τελευτᾷ δὲ ἐν Κύπρῳ
ἑαυτὸν ὑπεξαγαγὼν ἐνδείᾳ τροφῆς, νόσῳ τῇ ὕδρωπι ληφθείς. ἔτη δὲ αὐτοῦ τῆς ζωῆς οβʹ. καὶ παῖδας μὲν κατέλιπεν Ἀρίσταρχον καὶ Ἀρισταγόραν. ἄμφω δὲ ἐγένοντο εὐήθεις, ὥστε καὶ ἐπράθη ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος· Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ἐλθόντα παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἐξωνήσαντο." - GO BACK OVER THIS. THERE IS SOMETHING HERE (Schironi, 3-4, 1) 
 * The Suda is from the 10th c CE. People literal centuries into the future knew all this, down to his father's name and the age at which he died, and yet people just a few centuries after him were struggling to reconstruct his works.
 * In other news, _he starved himself to death_?? Because he had "an excess of watery fluid collecting in the cavities or tissues of the body" (per Google's definition of dropsy)??? That's a lot to take in.

* Important: Zenodotus wrote the γλωσσαι, which is allegedly a formal list of unusual words that later scholars used when they cited Zenodotus. When Dionysius Thrax  wrote his third point, about γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἱστοριῶν, was he referencing Zenodotus' list in particular?
