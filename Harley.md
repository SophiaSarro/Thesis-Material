The word μεταγραφω appears in the Ven A scholia 8 times. Twice, it is in the phrase ζηνοδοτον μεταγραφοντα, plus an additional instance of οτι ζηνοδοτος μεταγραφει. Since the word co-occurs so frequently with Zenodotus, it seems likely that it is a critical term. (But why Zenodotus, as opposed to Aristarchus or anyone else? What was Zenodotus doing that they weren't?)
It appears five times with οτι and three times with προς (including one that's σημειουνται τινες προς, which essentially spells out what the προς usually means).

There are 17 instances of ακαιρον, so whether or not it's an actual critical term, it's at least a word that's used in both the Harley and the Ven A. Let's translate some scholia, I guess.
* urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:7.208.comment, Commenting on Iliad 7.75 - 7.75 has a diple on it. "Because, both of its own about others (?????). And because the first man and foremost warrior cutting short (come back to συγκοπήν, what's the best way to translate that participle?). And because Hector [ακαιρως διον εαυτον]."
****** Revisit this one. It's short, and the syntax seems simple, but for some reason I can't get it to make sense.
* urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msAint.hmt:18.7.comment, Commenting on Iliad 18.84-18.85 - Is το ειδυᾳ a form of το ειδος? I don't know where the upsilon is coming from. Anyway, if they are the same word, ειδος means "type, species. derivational status (i.e. primitive or derived)" (Dickey 235). Either way, the scholion says "Saying ειδυᾳ is ακαιρον."
Ακαιρον appears 7 times with the obelos and twice with the diple. Of the ones that are obelized, Zenodotus appears twice.
