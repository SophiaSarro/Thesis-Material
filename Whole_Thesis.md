Introduction:

Aristarchus of Samothrace was not supposed to have a notable legacy. According to what few sources on his life remain, Aristarchus most likely died in exile, some 400 miles from his beloved Library of Alexandria, where his ideas were housed and his influence began. Aristarchus' exile itself was unceremonious, and existed as a footnote in the greater elimination of dissenters enacted by Ptolemy VIII; however, this thesis operates under the [idea] that footnotes are not to be overlooked.

Reasonably, Aristarchus' legacy should have ended there. Or, if it insisted on clinging to relevancy, then it should have ended when the last of his estimated 800 works disappeared from the Greek canon. By some miracle, this never came to pass. Instead, his legacy endured in the form of the Aristarchan literary-critical tradition, influencing scholars well into the Middle Ages. This literary-critical tradition includes the use of seimeia, or critical signs, first used by Aristarchus, as well as the methodology which would compel a scholar to use these signs. Both of these components will be elaborated upon within this thesis. This thesis does not claim to be an exhaustive account of whom was influenced by Aristarchus, and in what respects. It instead offers a close examination of the works of a few scholars whose works were influenced by Aristarchus, and by each other: namely, Dionysius Thrax, Aristonicus of Alexandria, and the unnamed scholiast of the Venetus A manuscript of the Iliad.

The scholiast of the Venetus A stands out among the aforementioned scholars, as he was farther removed from Aristarchus by several centuries. While Dionysius Thrax lived at the same time as Aristarchus, and Aristonicus lived roughly a century later, the composition of the Venetus A manuscript in the tenth century C.E. places the Venetus A scholiast at a twelve century separation from Aristarchus. This information, coupled with the knowledge that Aristarchus' works had most likely ceased to exist by this point, raises the question of how closely the Venetus A scholiast could have possibly aligned his literary-critical interests with those who set the foundation of the literary-critical tradition. This paper aims to prove, through close readings and topic models of the scholia, that the legacy of Aristarchus was still alive and well by the tenth century, as ideas of what was relevant in literary criticism remained largely the same.

The thesis itself consists of three chapters, each covering a different aspect that will lead to the overall understanding of the Aristarchan tradition. The first chapter explains the evolution of the Aristarchan tradition through the texts left behind by Dionysius Thrax, Aristonicus, and George Choiroboskos. The understanding of the tradition will then be compared to literary-critical interests of the Venetus A scholiast in the second and third chapters. While the second chapter focuses on close reading of the scholia, the third chapter takes a different approach, focusing on topic models of the scholia.

At the end of this thesis, topic models are included to visually demonstrate the findings of the third chapter. [Write more about this.]

As a glance at the bibliography will show, this thesis makes use of only a select few modern sources. I was fortunate enough to have access to primary sources on the Aristarchan tradition, allowing me to understand how notable scholars understood the tradition in their own words. Among these primary sources was the last remaining page of περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας by Aristonicus, which has been preserved in the Venetus A manuscript. As the Venetus A manuscript has been digitized, I had the rare opportunity to utilize this oft-overlooked source. This opportunity only grew as I was granted the chance to create a digital edition and translation of this page, alongside Professor Neel Smith from the College of the Holy Cross and Professor Graeme Bird from Gordon College. I have included our new translation of the text as an appendix to this thesis.

Chapter 1: Close Reading

Introduction to the Verbal Adjective:

When studying the literary-critical interests of a scholiast, it only makes sense to do a close reading of the scholia he wrote. However, as the Venetus A manuscript houses 14,336 scholia, I could not hope to read and analyze and sort all of them as just one part of a one-year project. If I wanted to accomplish anything, I first had to select a group of scholia to focus on - the question was, which group of scholia would yield meaningful results?

The idea to analyze scholia containing verbal adjectives stemmed from their conspicuous abundance. Verbal adjectives - words ending in -τέον - appear very infrequently in the larger Greek corpus. The Venetus A scholiast, however, employed an impressive 78 verbal adjectives in his scholia. Only two of these verbal adjectives - φυλακτεον and - are used in the context of what characters of the Iliad must do in the story. The remaining 76 verbal adjectives are used to instruct readers on how they should interpret the text. This ratio of 2:76 demonstrates that when talking about a subject other than his literary-critical interests, the scholiast does not use verbal adjectives noticeably more frequently than any other writer; when talking about his literary-critical interests, however, he uses them far more frequently. As verbal adjectives have a special literary-critical significance to the Venetus A scholiast, there seemed to be no better group of scholia to examine than those containing verbal adjectives.

Momentarily, it seemed that I had isolated the perfect group of scholia to focus on. Any contentment I had was quashed by the revelation that there are over 800 scholia containing verbal adjectives in the Venetus A. While I could have sifted through these scholia at random, hoping to stumble across something of meaning, I figured that there must have been a more organized and effective way. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of material I was dealing with, and groping for any semblance of a direction, I began sorting the verbal adjectives into tables.

While the table went through several iterations, I eventually settled on dividing it into three categories: those having to do with marking for proper pronunciation, those used to make a scholarly argument, and technical vocabulary only used in the context of literary criticism.

When listing the six steps to thoroughly understanding a text, Dionysius begins with ἀνάγνωσις, the act of reading aloud. Only once a scholar has internalized the spoken nuances of the text, he argues, can they progress to the next stages of literary analysis. Without cross-referencing it with the Venetus A, we may have assumed that this disporopotionate concern for reading aloud was purely a concern of Dionysius. However, the Venetus A scholiast also shares this concern. Eighteen out of his seventy-four relevant verbal adjectives - or an impressive 24.32% - pertain to reading aloud. As the concern shows up in both Dionysius' and Aristonicus' respective veins of the Aristarchan tradition, it is reasonable to conclude that it stems back to Aristarchus himself.

The similarities, however, do not end there. Dionysius further breaks down the process of ἀνάγνωσις into three separate categories: delivery (ὑπόκρισιν), prosody (προσῳδίαν), and pauses (διαστολήν). The latter two categories can be, and frequently are, alluded to by the Venetus A scholiast as well. In his commentary on Dionysius, George Choroboskos claimed that prosody can be further broken down into three categories: tone, length, and breathing. All three of these appear as concerns of the Venetus A scholiast, as evidenced by Table B. In fact, the only facet of ἀνάγνωσις that the scholiast overlooks is delivery (ὑπόκρισιν). This would definitely be the hardest to communicate in a written format. Dionysius, by divorcing his work from any given edition of the Iliad, gave himself the freedom to go as in-depth as he desires with basic concepts such as ὑπόκρισιν; however, just as the Venetus A scholiast would not pause to explain what a vowel is, like Dionysius does, he likewise cannot pause in the many things he has to do in order to explain something as tangentially related to the source material as proper delivery.

The second step, Scholarly Work, encompasses Dionysius' second, third, fourth, and fifth components. Unlike ἀνάγνωσις, which must be done before any of the other components can commence, these components can be done in seemingly any order, thus relegating them to the same step.

Chapter 2: Topic Modeling

Introduction to Topic Modeling:

While close reading of scholia is an integral facet of my research, as evidenced by the Verbal Adjective chapter, it does not need to be the only component. In prior decades, this would not be the case: research of scholia was limited to transcriptions and close readings, fit within the short span of time that a scholar could occupy space in a manuscript library. However, due to the recent digitization of the Venetus A manuscript, I can take advantage of a process called topic modeling and analyse scholia in a way other than close reading.

Topic modeling is a form of natural language processing which forms a statistical model of the “topics” which occur in any given corpus. A computer forms these “topics” by grouping the units - words or n-grams, depending on the model - which co-occur the most frequently. This process is known as text-mining, and allows scholars to discover recurring semantic structures throughout the corpus which would not otherwise be readily recognizeable. Additionally, the use of topic modeling allows me to make observations about the entire corpus of scholia in the Venetus A manuscript without doing a close reading of all 14,336 of them. While this task would almost certainly yield interesting results, it simply was not a feasible goal for one component of a year-long project.

Another advantage of topic modeling is that it yields empirical results. Anyone who wants to replicate or build off of the findings in this paper can use the lists of words included with this thesis, as well as the stop words list, in order to get their own results. The stop words list is a collection of words which the computer is ordered to ignore when making its statistical models. For instance, articles and particles will appear evenly throughout the text regardless of context; for this reason, they are not important to include in the topic models, and thus are placed on the stop words list and filtered out. The different lists of words, meanwhile, display the different stages of topic modeling explored in this thesis.

The Initial Model:

My initial topic model was created using the list labeled All Words, which fittingly contains all words included in the scholia.

The Updated Model:

While my initial model was promising, there were several issues with it that I sought to correct. Firstly, as the words had not yet been tokenized, different forms of the same name (i.e. Αρισταρχος, Αρισταρχ) were counted as separate tokens. Thus, if the name were to appear as a key word, it might take up two spots instead of one, taking the spot from another word which would have given us a more well-rounded understanding of the topic. Ideally, I would have been able to tokenize every word in order to avoid this; unfortunately, that was not possible due to time constraints. It was possible, however, to replace each person and place name with their URN tag. Within the digital edition of the Venetus A, every person, place, and ethnic group is assigned its own URN tag. This way, a search of the person's tag could yield all of their appearances, even if they were referred to by two different names (Achilles, son of Peleus). Replacing each occurance of a person's name with their URN would eliminate some of the unnecessary repetition.

Topic Modeling With Critical Signs:

Building off of the last chapter of this thesis, I also created topic models incorporating the verbal adjectives, and their co-occurence with the Aristarchan critical signs. As was previously established, the verbal adjectives tell what a scholar should do, according to the scholiast, when reading and analysing the texts. The critical signs serve a similar purpose, explaining the literary critics's thought process while creating a critical edition. Both the critical signs and the verbal adjectives point to literary-critical interests which were deemed important during the creation of the Venetus A. Thus, I wanted to see how these features of the text worked in tandem. I created a topic models of the scholia including verbal adjectives based on whether they were marked with a diple, a dotted diple, an asteriskos, or an obelos. (There are no scholia which contain a verbal adjective and are marked with an antisigma, a dotted antisigma, or a reverse dotted antisigma.)

Of these topic models, I found it most telling to the "key" verbal adjectives of each category. In the diple topic models, διασταλτεον appears in the ten "key" words in seven out of fifteen topics. Στικτεον, γραπτεον, ακουστεον, παραιτητεον, περισπαστεον, προπερισπαστεον, ιστεον, αναγνωστεον, and εκληπτεον all appear in the key words of these fifteen topics as well. Notably, these words mainly fall into the Marking and Pronouncing category and the Scholarly Argument category of verbal adjectives. After finding this, I wondered if the other critical signs followed this pattern. I hypothesized that the obelos in particular would have more verbal adjectives from the Editorial Vocabulary category, as the obelos is used to show when a line has been judged un-Homeric.

The dotted diple topic model followed the same pattern as the diple topic model, with διασταλτεον, ακουστεον, ρητεον, συσταλτεον, προπερισπαστεον, and προενεκτεον all showing up as key terms. Surprisingly to me, the obelos topic model did as well. The key words in the topics of the obelos-marked scholia include οξυτονητεον, περισπαστεον, στικτεον, μεταληπτεον, αναστρεπτεον, διασταλτεον, θετεον, ψιλωτεον, and γραπτεον. However, outside of the verbal adjectives, the obelos topic model was markedly different from the others. It was the only model to include forms of αθετεω (specifically, αθετειται and αθετουνται) as key words. It also included the word αστερισκοι as a key word, inherently connecting the obelos and asteriskos categories. This makes sense, as according to Aristonicus, the asteriskos is used to denote correctly-placed lines that are placed wrongly - and thus, are marked with an obelos - elsewhere in the text. The asteriskos topic model, however, does not include οβελοι as a key term, making this relationship seem rather one-sided.

The presence of Scholarly Argument verbal adjectives in the obelos key terms, as opposed to Editorial Vocabulary verbal adjectives, speaks to the intermediary function of the Scholarly Argument category. Whereas I had assumed that scholia with an obelos would contain verbal adjectives expressing that "one must obelize this line because," the verbal adjectives were absent from the key words list. This is because, seemingly, the obelos tells the reader all that they need to know; after placing the obelos, the scribe is more concerned with making a scholarly argument for the inaccuracy of the line, rather than reiterating that the line is inaccurate. For instance, one of the scholia in question is as follows:

αμφιβολος η στιγμη δια το μοριον επει και αυτο αμφιβολον· ομως δε εις το ος υποτακτικον αρθ αυτο μεταληπτεον

This scholion comments on line 1.388 of the Iliad, in which Achilles weeps to his mother and implores her to supplicate Zeus. The line is one of sixteen obelized on the page, three of which are also marked with an asteriskos. The first line of this scholion explains that this line is inthe middle of a section of obelized lines. It then explains how the postpositive word must be taken, but provides no further information as to the athetesis.

Conclusion:

Through close readings of the scholia and topic modeling, I identified many literary-critical interests shared between the Venetus A scholiast and the earlier followers of the Aristarchan tradition. Specifically, both Dionysius Thrax and the Venetus A scholiast instructed their readers in terms of anagnosis, scholarly arguments, and krisis. In terms of anagnosis, while the Venetus A scholiast did not touch upon delivery, he mirrors Dionysius in terms of his discussion of prosody and pauses. Additionally, when talking about prosody, the Venetus A scholiast covered tone, length, and breathing, which are the facets which George Choiroboskos alleged would have mattered to Dionysius Thrax. Given that they shared so many literary-critical interests, I believe that the scholiast of the Venetus A took much inspiration from the followers of Aristarchus in terms of his own methodology. I cannot say for certain whether the scholiast had access to the Techne Grammatike itself, or the works of someone commenting on the Techne Grammatike, but the overlap in interests displayed by these scholars, centuries apart, is too significant to be a coincidence.

Topic modeling allowed us to confirm what we had learned through close readings, as it allowed us to take every scholion throughout the Venetus A into account. The striking amount of "scholarly argument" topics, whether centering around backstories or grammar, reinforced our findings that the scholiast focused on many of the same topics as the early followers of Aristarchus. After all, Dionysius Thrax dedicated four of his six components of literary criticism to the construction of scholarly arguments; it was cleary very important to him, and based upon our topic models, we can conclude that this same step was exceedingly important to the scholiast as well.

One of the most important facets of our findings is that they are empirical and, to an extent, replicable. While not every topic model will be identical by nature of the software, any future scholar could check our findings by using the same list of words and stopwords list, and generating similar topic models to analyze. This is important because it is a relatively new phenomenon in Classics, and especially in studying manuscripts. For centuries, the study of manuscripts has been limited to believing the obervations of a few select scholars, who had days or merely hours with the manuscripts to collect their findings. To create something replicable, which anyone can access and replicate, was only made possible through the rise of digital humanities. Thus, while this is the conclusion of my thesis, I firmly do not believe that it is the conclusion of this research. I hope, and expect, that others will pick up where I left off, capitalizing on updated editions of the manuscript and new analytical software to build off of the findings contained in this thesis.
