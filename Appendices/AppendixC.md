# Appendix C: Aristonicus περὶ τῶν σημείων τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας


## Greek text

*1* ...]ἦ τὸ *ἔφη*.
*2* ὁ δὲ τοῦτο μὴ νοήσας ἀλλα λαβὼν πάλιν τὸ <q>φη</q> ἀντὶ τοῦ <q>ως</q> ὑπέταξεν ἐκ περισσοῦ~
*3* “πέφραδέ τε τρώεσσι καὶ εὐχόμενος ἔπος ηύδα”
*4* σημειοῦται δὲ πρὸς τὸν αὐτὸν ἀπεριστίκτωι διπλῆι τὰς ὁμωνυμίας ἁπάσας.
*5* ὅτι οὐ νοησας τὸ τοιοῦτον ἔγραψεν ὁτὲ μὲν *πυλαιμένεα* ὁτὲ δὲ *κυλαιμένεα*. 
*6* πρὸς μὲν δὴ Ζηνόδοτον αὐτῷ ἠ παράθεσις τῆς περιεστιγμένης διπλῆς προς εκάστην γραφὴν ἀκριβέστερον θεωρεῖται;
*7* τὸν δὲ ὀβελὸν ἔλαβεν, ἐκ τῆς  Ζηνοδότου διορθώσεως:
*8* παρετίθει δὲ αὐτὸν τοῖς ἐκβαλλομένοις ἐκ τῆς ποιήσεως στίχοις ὡς τοῖς νεκροῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
*9* τῆς δὲ ἀθετήσεως αὐτῷ διττὸς ὁ λόγος;
*10* ὁ μὲν γάρ εστι σημαίνων ὅτι οὐχ Ὁμήρου τὸ ἔπος, ὡς ἐλέγετο ἐπι τοῦ  “τέρπεται ἐν θαλίῃ καὶ ἔχει καλλίσφυρον Ἥβην” (14.500):
*11* ἀδύνατον γὰρ τὴν διηνεκῶς παρθένον παραδεδομένην γεγαμῆσθαι.
*12* ὁ δὲ αἰτίαν ἐπιφέρει ὡς τῶν ποιημάτων ἐν τῇ τάξει διημαρτημένων;
*13* ὅταν δ'  ὁ  Ἀγαμέμνων λέγῃ προς τὸν  Ἀχιλλέα  “αἰεὶ γάρ τοι έρις τε φίλη πόλεμοί τε μάχαι τε” (1.177);
*14* ἐντᾶυθα ἠθετῆσθαι φησὶ χάριν τοῦ βασιλέως ὀφείλοντος εἰ τοιοῦτος ἐστιν ἐν πολέμῳ ὁ κατ' ἐπικουρίαν ἥκων.
*15* διόπερ ἐπὶ μὲν τοῦ λεγομένου ὑπο Ἀγαμέμνονος ὀβελὸς παρακείσεται.
*16* καὶ προς τοῦτο ἀστερίσκος;
*17* δηλοῖ δὲ τοῦτο ὅπου ἂν ᾐ κείμενος σὺν τῷ ὀβελῷ ὅτι ὁμήρου μέν ἐστι φαύλως δ' ἐνταῦθα κεῖται.
*18* ἔστι δὲ καὶ έτερος τρόπος τῆς ἀθετήσεως;
*19* ὅτ' ἂν τοῖς αὐτοῖς στίχοις πολλάκις χρῆται ὁτε μὲν οἰκείοις περιτιθεὶς προσώποις τὰ λεγόμενα ὁτε δὲ οὕ, ὡς ἔχει τὰ τοῦ κύκλωπος τοῦ ἀνημερωτάτου ῥήματα ὑπο τοῦ συνετωτάτου Νέστορος λεγόμενα προς Τηλέμαχον. 
*20* “ὦ ξεῖνοι τίνες ἐστὲ πόθεν πλεῖθ' ὑγρὰ κέλευθα ἠ τι κατα πρηξιν η μαψιδίως ἀλάλησθε οῖά τε ληϊστῆρες ὑπειρ άλα τοιτ' αλοωνται ψυχὰς παρθένοι.” *21* ταῦτα γὰρ ἥρμοζεν ὑπὸ τοῦ κύκλωπος  Ὀδυσσεῖ εἰρῆσθαι οὐχ' ὑπὸ  Νέστορος Τηλεμάχῳ⁑
   


## English translation

(*1*) ...] the word *efê* ("he said").
(*2*) When Zenodotus did not understand this, but once again took *fê* as equivalent to *hôs*, he attached the superfluous line (*Iliad* 14.500):
(*3*) "He showed it to the Trojans, and boasting spoke."
(*4*) In response to (the same) Zenodotus, Aristarchus marks all instances of synonymous expressions with an undotted *diplê*,
(*5*) because Zenodotus writes sometimes "Pylaimenes" and sometimes "Kylaimenes" since he did not understand this sort of thing.
(*6*) In response to Zenodotus, his (Aristarchus’) placement of the dotted diple more specifically against each reading can be observed.
(*7*) He (Aristarchus) took (over) the obelos from the edition of Zenodotus.
(*8*) And as he rejected lines from the poem, he placed it (the obelos) next to them, as if to corpses of humans.
(*9*) His (Aristarchus') rationale for athetesis is two-fold.
(*10*) The first use is when indicating that the line (epos) is not Homeric, as was indicated on the line "he delights in the feast and he has as wife Hebe with lovely ankles."
(*11*) For it is impossible for the one who is perpetually virgin to be given in marriage.
(*12*) The second use brings the charge (of athetesis) on the grounds that the lines are out of place.
(*13-14*) Aristarchus says that athetesis should be applied whenever Agamemnon says to Achilles, "war and strife have always been friends to you" because the king is indebted to him if the one coming to his aid in battle is this sort of person.
(*15*) For this reason, an obelos will be placed on what is said by Agamemnon,
(*16*) and next to this an asterisk.
(*17*) Whenever it (the asterisk) appears together with an obelos, it shows that the line is Homeric, but improperly (*faulôs*) placed here.
(*18*) There is a second manner of this athetesis,
(*19*) when he (the poet) uses the same lines repeatedly, applying what is said to appropriate characters in some cases, and in some cases not, as when the phrase of the most uncivilised Cyclops is spoken to Telemachus by the most intelligent Nestor.
*20* ""
*21* For he composed this phrase to be spoken by the Cyclops to Odysseus, not by Nestor to Telemachus.
