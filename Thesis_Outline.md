Introduction:
What is the Homeric tradition? Which manuscripts will I be looking at? etc.
[Big question that I am seeking to answer]
Somewhere in here, I probably need to introduce the people who will be frequently named (Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Aristonicus, etc) and explain how their scholarly traditions relate to each other. Personally, I like the idea of taking a historic detour before getting into all the technical stuff. Not only will it acquaint readers with necessary terms, but acknowledging the people behind the traditions adds to the "why should I care" factor. (Maybe there isn't supposed to be a "why should I care" factor in a thesis, but why should I care?)

MAIN IDEA 1: WORKING WITH CRITICAL SIGNS

Section One: The Aristarchan Critical Signs
Discuss the page at the beginning of the Ven A
Add footnote discussing work with Professor Smith and Professor Bird on translation
Images of critical signs for reference

Section Two: Intro to Topic Modelling
How is it done?
Discuss Professor Smith's new parsing program, and the advantages to using it over Morpheus
"When the topic modelling is done, we can expect to see multiple clusters of words; these clusters have no inherent meaning, but we can assign them meaning"

Section Three: Topic Modelling With Critical Signs
Are there words and critical signs that frequently co-occur?
Back to Aristonicus - are the critical signs used the way he said they would be?
Are the critical signs used the same in each manuscript? Which clusters show up for which critical signs in which manuscripts?
This seems like a good place for a table, because there's a lot of info here. 

Section Four: Tautologies
Check when the Venetus A scribe uses the antisigma to mark a tautology. Note who says the line, where it appears, and which passage it allegedly duplicates.
This raises the question of what the scholiasts and scribes saw as Homeric. Professor Smith mentioned the other day that the adjective for Homeric comes in degrees, so while some passages are just plain Homeric, others are "the most Homeric."
Do the Twins scribes mark tautologies at all?

MAIN IDEA 2: WORKING WITH WORDS

Section Five: Topic Modelling Verbal Adjectives
Explain the significance of words in the -τεον found in the Venetus A scholia
Transition from Main Idea 1 to Main Idea 2 by demonstrating that the same method of analysis can be used with both
Are there patterns as to which words frequently co-occur with verbal adjectives? 

Section Six: Dionysius Thrax
Explain his work, and his six steps to thoroughly engaging with a text
Do any of the clusters overlap with his categories?
