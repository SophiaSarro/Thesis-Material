Section 1:
* Marking/Pronouncing corresponds to the first point almost entirely
* As of right now, I am not sure what the second point, about the ποιητικοὺς τρόπους, corresponds to on the table. That will have to be observed when I finally use that Jupyter notebook. ("Poetic figures": D.T. says this involves ἐξήγσις)
* The third part is about understanding the γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἱστοριῶν. This would correspond with verbal adjectives such as ληπτέον and its derivitives, νοητέον, and probably most of the other perceiving words. That's not to say that they're the same, but given that group three is mostly about understanding the story on the level of its syntax and content, the words about understanding and the lead-up to understanding will probably apply.
* The fourth part is about discovering/inventing etymologies. That seems like it will span sections 2 - 4. It obviously has to do the most with constructing, but the explanation might dip into other topics.
* The fifth point is about ἐκλογισμός, or "keeping of accounts. For this reason, I feel like our section on communication would fit best.
* The sixth part, about krisis, should be mostly about ἀθετητέον and other words of construction.
